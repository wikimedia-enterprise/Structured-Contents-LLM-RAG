The Horseshoe run of the Union Steam Ship Company carried passengers and cargo between Australian and New Zealand ports in the late 19th century. Several ships were used from 1882 for about 15 years: the S.S. Hauroto, the S.S. Manapouri, the S.S. Tarawera, and the S.S. Wairarapa: In the early 1890s there was a battle between the Union Co and Huddart Parker on various Australasian routes including the Melbourne-Hobart route, with undercutting by cheap fares and steamers shadowing each other from port to port. On 29 October 1894, the SS Wairarapa wrecked on Great Barrier Island north east of Auckland. Sailing in a dense fog at high speed, the ship rammed into the cliffs at Miner's Point. The hull was breached and the ship immediately started listing. Only 50 passengers and crewmen survived the wreck; 121 were lost. An inquiry later blamed the captain for maintaining excessive speed."

Hans Ertel (March 24, 1904 in Berlin – July 2, 1971 in Berlin) was a German natural scientist and a pioneer in geophysics, meteorology and hydrodynamics. Life and work. Hans Ertel began his scientific career at the former Preußischen Meteorologischen Institut (Prussian Meteorological Institute), where the representatives of the Austrian school of meteorology, (Heinrich von Ficker and Albert Defant) had formative influence on him and gave him their lasting support. Ertel continued the works of Felix Maria von Exner-Ewarten, a leading theoretical meteorologist of his time who lived in Vienna, and he completed many of them. He developed into a capable theoretical physicist early on and he was already to publish research results or theoretical approaches in this subject as a young man. Ertel's famous vorticity equation of 1942 belongs today to the basic work of modern geophysics and astrophysics. In 1943, he was given the position of professor for meteorology and geophysics at the University of Innsbruck, and he also attended lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld. After Second World War, Ertel was interested in a professorship for geophysics at the University of Munich, but was instead appointed to professor for geophysics at Berlin University in 1946, where he also became the director of the Institute for Meteorology and Geophysics which belonged to the university. At the invitation of various scientists, such as Hilding Köhler, Markus Bath and Carl-Gustav Rossby, with whom he also maintained long friendships, Ertel held lectures at Stockholm University and Uppsala University in Sweden and took part in congresses, thereby creating a good reputation for his field of research at the Berlin University. As a member of the Deutschen Akademie der Wisschaften zu Berlin, (German Academy of Sciences Berlin), or DAW, Ertel founded and led the Institute for Physical Hydrography of this academy as of 1948. In 1949, Ertel was elected to be a full member of the DAW and was its vice president from 1951 to 1961. During this time, he saw to the founding of some new academy institutes, and also ensured that all of Germany could participate during the International Geophysical Years (1957/58 and 1958/59). The research on geo-ecology, which began under his leadership at the institute, is considered to be pioneering work today. The following areas of emphasis in research from his time as leader of the Institute enriched scientific knowledge and the subject areas to a great degree: The results of his work were regularly published in specialized international and national magazines (e.g., the Monthly Reports of the German Academy of Sciences), as well as in the magazine of the institute, Acta Hydrophysica, and soon led to a high reputation for himself and for his institute. Even beyond his institute, Ertel made sure that the magazines, Gerlands Beiträge zur Geophysik, Zeitschrift für Meteorologie and Forschungen und Fortschritte appeared and he collaborated on the Deutschen Literaturzeitschrift himself. Furthermore, he held guest lectures abroad, especially at conferences, participated in research trips and supported international projects. Personally, Ertel was concerned with coastal protection, theoretical geomorphology, meteorological problems and cosmology. Selected publications. The following publications are in the Academy Library of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences: Between 1991 and 2006, Wilfried Schröder published Collected Works of Hans Ertel, seven volumes in all, Science Edition, Bremen. A commemorative work appeared on the 100th anniversary of his birth with the title, ""Meteorological and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics"", published by Wilfried Schröder, with contributions by internationally renowned scientists, Science Edition, Bremen. His geophysical works on hydrodynamics appeared as Ertel Collected Works ""Geophysical Fluid Dynamics"", published by Wilfried Schröder, Science Edition, Bremen, 2004. Commemorative articles on Hans Ertel by Wilfried Schröder appeared in EOS (2004), WMO Bulletin (2004), as well as in a review in Idöjaras (Budapest, 2004). A biography of Hans Ertel by Wilfried Schröder was published in the magazine of the Royal Meteorological Society, ""Weather"", in 1999. An article on the life and work of Hans Ertel, also by Wilfried Schröder, is also contained in ""Dictionary of Scientific Biographies""."

67504696,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinaka_vina,Pinaka vina,"Abstract. ""The essential difference between this instrument and the been is that, in the place of chords it has but one string of wire, strongly stretched. To draw out the sound, a bow like that of a bass is prest upon this chord, at the same time that another part of it is struck or rubbed with a little stick. Frans Balthazar Solvyns, The pināka vīnā (Hindi: पिनाक pinnak + Hindi: वीणा veena) was an Indian musical instrument, a musical bow that was itself played with a bow. It has also been transliterated pinaki vina and pinak. It appeared similar to the rudra veena (also called ""bīn "" or ""been ""), with a long bar held over the musician's shoulder and resting on the ground, with large gourds attached at each end for resonators. However, where the rudra veena has multiple strings and frets, the pinaka vina had only one string made of wire and no frets. Where the rudra veena was a stick zither (with a straight and rigid bar for the instrument's body), the pinaka vīnā was a musical bow (its body a long stick turned up at each end). The instrument was sounded with a bow. The musician chose notes with a stick held against the strings, able to slide it up and down on the string, in the same way a bottle slides on a slide guitar 's strings. Origins. Pinaka was the name of the bow (arrow-shooting variety) of Shiva. The musical bow pināka made it into literature by the 12th century C.E. in the Saraswati Hridayalankar or Bharatbhashya by Nanyadeva (1097–1133 C.E.) In the mid-12th century it was considered to be a very important instrument by Haripala, a Gujarati king (son of Karna). The instrument was recorded in 1456 as having a second resonator. By 1810 the instrument was rare, and much of our knowledge about its appearance comes from drawings made by Frans Balthazar Solvyns, an artist who illustrated many common scenes in the 1790s and early 1800s. As the pinak was a northern instrument, a bowed southern instrument also existed, the ravanahatha stick zither. The pināka and ravanahatha are tied together in literature. As pināka was Shiva's bow, the ravanahatha was created in legend by the ascetic demon king Ravana, a devotee of Shiva."

11575116,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gibault,Pierre Gibault,"Abstract. Father Pierre Gibault (7 April 1737 – 16 August 1802) was a Jesuit missionary and priest in the Northwest Territory in the 18th century, and an American Patriot during the American Revolution. Frontier Missionary. Gibault was born 7 April 1737 at Montreal, the son of Pierre Gibault and Marie Saint-Jean, and was baptised the same day. He was educated as a missionary and ordained as priest at Quebec on 19 March 1768, and was quickly appointed Vicar General of the Archbishop of Quebec for the Illinois country. When France lost the Northwest Territory to Great Britain in 1763, Jesuit priests were expelled. Catholic communities had to rely on local laity to lead their congregations. In July he arrived at Michilimackinac, where he spent a week attending to the religious needs of the Catholics, some of whom had not seen a priest for many years. Fr. Gibault arrived in Kaskaskia on 8 September 1768, where he served Catholics of French and Indian ethnicity, as well as Irish Catholic soldiers in the British Army 's 18th Regiment of Foot who were stationed there. He first arrived in Vincennes in 1769, where a crowd greeted him with cries of ""Save us, Father; we are nearly in Hell!"" Father Gibault oversaw a circuit of parishes, including Vincennes, Kaskaskia, Ste Genevieve, and Cahokia. He also visited settlements as far as Ouiatenon, Peoria, and St. Joseph. The territory was still considered dangerous frontier, and Gibault carried a gun and two pistols. In 1770 he blessed the little wooden chapel that had been erected at Paincourt, the present site of St. Louis. Gibault officiated at the chapel regularly in spite of being under the authority of the bishop of Quebec and being a British subject, and he performed dozens of masses and sixty-four baptisms until 1772, when a Capuchin priest named Valentine became the first resident priest. The Patriot Priest. Father Gibault was in Kaskaskia in 1778 when George Rogers Clark arrived. According to Clark, Fr. Gibault stated that he supported the Americans, but was concerned for his Catholic congregation. Clark assured him that by the laws of Virginia, they would be free to worship as they wished. Clark also informed Gibault of the newly signed treaty between the United States and France. Gibault convinced the Canadian residents under his care to support the Americans. He further convinced the residents to recognize American continental paper money. Gibault often exchanged Spanish milled dollars for an equal amount of continental promissary notes, and by 1783 estimated that this cost him 7,800 livres. Father Gibault, together with Spanish trader Francis Vigo, is considered to have funded most of the Illinois campaign. Clark told Fr. Gibault of his plans to take Vincennes, but Gibault stated that he could do this without troops. Fr. Gibault and Dr. Jean-Baptiste Laffont (surname variations include LaFond, LaFont) left Kaskaskia on 14 July 1778 and converted an overwhelming majority of Vincennes residents to the American cause. The population raised a new American flag at the abandoned Fort Sackville, wrapping the British flag around a stone and discarding it into the Wabash River. Gibault returned to Kaskaskia and reported the news to Clark. When Lt-Governor Henry Hamilton retook Fort Sackville and Captain Leonard Helm, Gibault found himself confined to Vincennes. Hamilton then captured Francis Vigo, a Spanish citizen and therefore a non-combatant. Father Gibault conducted Sunday mass, then led his entire congregation to Fort Sackville, where he informed Hamilton that all supplies would be denied to the garrison until Vigo was released. Vigo was released, and informed Clark of the capture of Vincennes. Gibault soon returned to Kaskaskia, and blessed a force of Canadians and Virginians led by Clark to re-capture Vincennes in February 1779. For his services to the Americans, Gibault was viewed disfavorably by his fellow clergy, who had remained loyal to the British government. Father Gibault actually requested a move to Quebec in 1788, but was denied by the Bishop due to a disadvantageous opinion that the government had formed of him. In a letter from Cahokia dated 1 May 1790, Father Gibault detailed his services and the debts owed him to Arthur St. Clair. He asked, as a ""concession,"" that the United States would legally grant some land in Kaskaskia- which had traditionally been used by priests- to him and his successors. The request was forwarded on and granted by President George Washington, but the newly appointed American Bishop objected. Without land or compensation, Father Gibault moved to New Madrid, Missouri, pastoring the parish of Saint-Isidore until his death on 16 August 1802. His body was sent to Canada, but his grave is unmarked. Namesakes. Gibault was featured in a collectors coin to celebrate the bicentennial of Indiana statehood."

Tharrawaddy Min (Burmese: သာယာဝတီမင်း, pronounced; 14 March 1787 – 17 November 1846) was the 8th king of the Konbaung Dynasty of Burma. He repudiated the Treaty of Yandabo and almost went to war with the British. Tharrawaddy was born Maung Khin to Crown Prince Thado Minsaw (son of King Bodawpaya) and Princess Min Kye on 14 March 1787. When his elder brother Bagyidaw ascended the throne in 1819, Tharrawaddy was appointed Heir Apparent. As crown prince, he fought in the First Anglo-Burmese War. In February 1837, he raised the standard of rebellion after escaping to Shwebo, the ancestral place of the Konbaung kings. Tharrawaddy succeeded in overthrowing Bagyidaw in April and was crowned king. Princess Min Myat Shwe, a granddaughter of Hsinbyushin, whom he married in 1809, was crowned as his chief queen (Nanmadaw Mibaya Hkaungyi). In 1841 King Tharrawaddy donated a 42-ton bell called the Maha Tissada Gandha Bell and 20 kilograms (44 lb) of goldplating to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon. His reign was rife with rumours of preparations for another war with the British who had added the Arakan and Tenasserim to their dominions. It was, however, not until 1852, after Tharrawaddy was succeeded by his son Pagan Min, that the Second Anglo-Burmese War broke out."

Mykhailo Andriienko-Nechytailo (French Michel Andreenko, also known as Mikhail Andriyenko-Nechitailo ""Mykhaylo Andreenko "", among other variations) (1894–1982) was a renowned Ukrainian, French, and Russian Modernist painter and stage designer. Mykhailo Andriienko-Nechytailo was born in 1894 in Odesa Ukraine. In 1912–1917, he studied under Roerikh, Rylov, and Bilibin at the art school of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in Saint Petersburg. In 1914–1916, he exhibited the composition Black Dome and his first cubist works in Saint Petersburg. In 1914, he participated in an international graphics exhibition in Leipzig. In 1917–1924, he devoted most of his time to designing stage sets for various theaters—in Saint Petersburg, Odesa, Prague, Paris, and for the Royal Opera in Bucharest.

Additional Housing Grant (abbrev: AHG) was an additional subsidy over and above the regular market subsidy and Central Provident Fund Housing Grant that new and resale HDB (Housing & Development Board) flat buyers in Singapore can enjoy. It offsets the purchase price of a new or resale HDB flat in Singapore, thereby reducing the housing loan a flat buyer needs to take. It was replaced by the Enhanced CPF Housing Grants in 2019. History. The AHG was first introduced on 3 Mar 2006 to help lower-income citizen families buy their first HDB flat. Under the AHG, households earning below the monthly income ceiling can qualify for an additional subsidy (refer table). The AHG has since undergone two enhancements. The first was in Aug 2007, and the second enhancement was on 6 Feb 2009. The increase in income ceiling from S$4,000 to S$5,000 increases the coverage of the AHG from 50 to 60 percent of resident households. In addition, the condition of continuous employment preceding the flat application is reduced from two years to one year. In September 2019, AHG was replaced by the Enhanced CPF Housing Grants. Scheme. The AHG will only be given once to each eligible family. As with the current scheme, the enhanced grant is given to Singapore Citizen only (not Singapore Permanent Residence spouse or an undischarged bankrupt), and can only be used as capital payment for the flat purchase. The balance, if any, must be used to reduce the mortgage loan before a housing loan from HDB can be granted. In addition to the current eligibility conditions to buy a new flat and the conditions of income ceiling and continuous employment, the family will have also to meet certain eligibility conditions, such as fulfilling a family nucleus, received any housing subsidies via various schemes and being not an undischarged bankrupt, to apply for the AHG."

He currently holds the Eni Chair of Competitive Dynamics and Global Strategy at LUISS Guido Carli University, in Rome, and concurrently holds a Chair of Strategy at the Macquarie Graduate School of Management, Macquarie University, in Sydney. Mathews has focused on the dynamics of technological catch-up by East Asian countries in high-tech industries, semiconductors, flat panel displays and most recently in alternative energy industries, solar photovoltaics and LEDs. He has developed dynamic strategy frameworks for analyzing these processes, and formulated a strategic synthesis in terms of the fundamental categories of resources, activities and routines. His most recent work applies this framework to explicating the reasons for success of industrial clusters, particularly those found in Taiwan, China and India. His book published in 2006, Strategizing, Disequilibrium and Profit (Stanford University Press), took these issues as framework to explore the evolution of industries and strategizing behaviors of firms theoretically. Strongly influenced by Joseph A. Schumpeter, Mathews viewed the disequilibrium and the dynamics of the economic system as both a setting and outcome of firms’ strategizing behaviours. Entrepreneurship plays a central role in creating the bundles of resources, activities and routines. His work (in 2010/11) focuses on the intersection between the development of new low-carbon industries and renewable energies; the rise of China and India and their pursuit of an East Asian model of development and highly-focused industrial clusters; and the adaptation of the capitalist economic system with its enormous growth and innovation potential to the demands of operating within natural ecological limits – such as within the framework of a ‘Circular Economy ’ as advanced in China.

Memoirs of a Geisha is a 2005 American epic period drama film directed by Rob Marshall and adapted by Robin Swicord from the 1997 novel of the same name by Arthur Golden. It tells the story of a young Japanese girl, Chiyo Sakamoto, who is sold by her impoverished family to a geisha house (okiya) to support them by training as and eventually becoming a geisha under the pseudonym ""Sayuri Nitta."" The film centers around the sacrifices and hardship faced by pre-World War II geisha, and the challenges posed by the war and a modernizing world to geisha society. It stars Zhang Ziyi in the lead role, with Ken Watanabe, Gong Li, Michelle Yeoh, Youki Kudoh, Suzuka Ohgo, and Samantha Futerman. The film was produced by Steven Spielberg (through production companies Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Pictures) and Douglas Wick (through Red Wagon Entertainment). Production was split between southern and northern California and a number of locations in Kyoto, including the Kiyomizu temple and the Fushimi Inari shrine. It was released as a limited release in the United States on December 9, 2005 and a wide release on December 23, 2005, by Columbia Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures, with the latter receiving studio credit only. The film garnered polarized reviews from critics worldwide and was moderately successful at the box office. It was also nominated for and won numerous awards, including nominations for six Academy Awards, and eventually won three: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. The acting, visuals, sets, costumes, and the musical score (composed by Spielberg's long-time collaborator John Williams) were praised, but the film was criticized for casting some non-Japanese actresses as Japanese women and for its style over substance approach. The Japanese release of the film was titled Sayuri, the titular character's geisha name. Plot. In 1929, Chiyo Sakamoto and her older sister Satsu are sold off by their poor father and taken to Gion, Kyoto. Chiyo is taken in by Kayoko Nitta, known as ""Mother"", the proprietress of a local okiya; Satsu, deemed too unattractive, is sent to a brothel instead. Chiyo also meets ""Granny"" and ""Auntie"" (who is kind to Chiyo), the other women who run the house; Pumpkin, another young girl; and the okiya 's resident geisha, Hatsumomo. Pumpkin and Chiyo soon begin their education to become future geisha. Hatsumomo, seeing Chiyo as a potential rival, immediately treats her with abuse. Hoping she will run away, Hatsumomo tells her where she can find Satsu in the red light district. They make plans to run away the following night. When Chiyo returns to the Okiya in the middle of that night, she stumbles upon Hatsumomo and her illicit boyfriend, Koichi. As the rest of the okiya wakes from the noise, Koichi runs away and Hatsumomo tries to frame Chiyo for stealing to distract from her affair. Mother begins to severely beat Chiyo who screams her innocence and yells that she saw Hatsumomo with a man. Mother orders Auntie to restrain Hatsumomo and checks between her legs for proof she was recently having sex. She rubs her wet fingers in front of Hatsumomo before slapping her in the face. Mother tells Hatsumomo that geisha are not free to love and that she will never see that man again. The next night, when Chiyo tries to escape via the rooftops, she falls and is injured. Due to her accumulating costs, Mother stops investing in her geisha training and instead makes her a menial servant to pay off her debts. Satsu flees Kyoto and Chiyo never sees her again. One day, while crying on a bridge, Chiyo encounters Chairman Ken Iwamura. He buys her a shaved ice dessert and gives her his handkerchief and some money to cheer her up. Touched by his kindness, Chiyo resolves to become a geisha so that she might become a part of the Chairman's life. Several years later, Pumpkin debuts as a maiko under Hatsumomo's tutelage. Shortly afterwards, Chiyo is taken under the wing of Mameha, one of the district's most prominent geisha, who persuades Mother to reinvest in Chiyo's geisha training, promising to pay her twice over after her debut. Chiyo becomes a maiko and receives the name Sayuri. At a sumo match, she is reintroduced to the Chairman, but attracts the attention of his gruff business partner Toshikazu Nobu. Thanks to Mameha's efforts, and in spite of Hatsumomo's scheming, Sayuri rises in popularity, attracting the attention of many men—including Dr. Crab and the Baron, Mameha's own danna. In a bidding war for Sayuri's deflowering ceremony, as part of her becoming a full geisha, the winning bid is a record-breaking amount from Dr. Crab, 15,000 yen. Mother immediately names Sayuri as her adopted daughter and the heiress to the okiya, crushing Pumpkin and enraging Hatsumomo. Upon returning home from the ceremony, Sayuri finds a drunken Hatsumomo in her room, where the latter has found the Chairman's handkerchief. This leads to a fight between them, in which Hatsumomo eventually starts a fire in the okiya. The building is saved, and Hatsumomo is banished from Gion. Sayuri's successful career is cut short by the outbreak of World War II. The Chairman relocates her to the safety of the countryside, where she works for a kimono maker. After the war ends, Nobu asks Sayuri to help him impress an American Colonel who could approve funding for their business. She reunites with Mameha, who reluctantly agrees to help her impress the Colonel, as well as Pumpkin, who is now working as an escort. Sayuri travels with Nobu, the Chairman, Mameha, Pumpkin, and the American soldiers to the Amami Islands. The Colonel propositions Sayuri, but she rejects him. Nobu confronts her after seeing this and confesses his desire to become her danna. Sayuri devises a plan to have Nobu catch her being intimate with the Colonel so that he will lose interest, and enlists Pumpkin's help to do so. However, Pumpkin brings the Chairman instead. When confronted, Pumpkin declares it her revenge for Mother adopting Sayuri instead of her. Disheartened, Sayuri gives up on her pursuit for the Chairman. After returning to Gion, Sayuri is summoned to a nearby tea-house. Expecting Nobu, she is instead surprised to see the Chairman. He confesses his feelings for Sayuri, admitting he always knew of her identity but refused to interfere with Nobu's feelings out of respect, and that he himself arranged for Mameha to become her mentor. Sayuri is finally able to confess her love to the Chairman and they share a kiss. Cast. Production. Music.

After 25 January, Memoirs of a Geisha was banned from screening by theaters in mainland China. Mao Yu, director of the Film Council's publicity department, said the film was ""sensitive and complex"".

3205393,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Falls_Dam,American Falls Dam,"Abstract. The American Falls Dam is a concrete gravity-type dam in the western United States, located near American Falls, Idaho, on river mile 714.7 of the Snake River. The dam and reservoir are a part of the Minidoka Project on the Snake River Plain and are used primarily for flood control, irrigation, and recreation. When the original dam was built in the 1920s by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the residents of American Falls were forced to relocate three-quarters of their town to make room for the reservoir. A second dam was completed in 1978 and the original structure was demolished. Although the dam itself is located in Power County, its reservoir also stretches northeastward into both Bingham County and Bannock County. Geology. A lava dam created a broad shallow lake in the area of the Raft River during the late Pliocene, over one million years ago. Much of the basin filled with fine sand, silt, and gravel; then the dam was breached and the lake drained. These sediments (called the Raft Formation) lie beneath most of the present-day American Falls Reservoir. At other times the Snake River was dammed completely by basalt flows extruded from vents. One lava dam a few miles downstream from the present American Falls Dam formed a reservoir in which more than 80 feet (24 m) of sediments (clay, silt, and sand) were deposited. This series of basalt flows and original sediments were covered by the new lake bed sediments and are named the Snake River Group and the American Falls Lake Beds. These events occurred up until the late Pleistocene, less than one million years ago. The Snake River has continued to erode its channel in the basalt and modify the lake bed sediments until the present time. Geography. The dam at American Falls is on the Snake River Plain at an elevation of 4,357 feet (1,328 m) above sea level. The topography near the river is gently rolling, with differences in elevation of less than two hundred feet (60 m). The original falls occur where the river channel narrows to about 600 feet (180 m) and cascades about fifty feet (15 m) in several 6-to-10-foot (2 to 3 m) drops over highly jointed basalt. The final drop is a plunge of about fifteen feet (4.6 m). History."

It is also known as silk-cotton tree because the capsules containing the seeds have a fluffy cotton-like substance similar to kapok. Another common name is buttercup tree because its yellow and bright flowers look like large-sized buttercups. In Theravada Buddhism, this plant is said to have used as the tree for achieved enlightenment, or Bodhi by nineteenth Buddha called ""Siddhaththa - සිද්ධත්ථ"". The plant is known as කිණිහිරියා (Kinihiriyaa) in Sinhala, and කණිකාර (Kanikaara) in Sanskrit.."

It is commonly known as water canna or Louisiana canna. It is native to the wetlands of tropical America and was introduced to England in 1730. It is also reportedly naturalized in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, Java and the Philippines. Description. It is a perennial herb growing 3–6 feet (91–183 cm) tall. It has narrow, blue-green (glaucous) leaves, atop of which sit its large, delicate, and pale yellow flowers. Distribution and habitat. C. glauca is native to the southeastern and south-central United States (Texas, Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina) as well as Mexico, Central America, South America and the West Indies. It is an aquatic species, growing as a marginal plant in up to about 15 cm of still or slow-moving water. Taxonomy. Nobuyuki Tanaka, one of the leading researchers on genus Canna, recognises two varieties of Canna glauca: Canna glauca var. glauca and Canna glauca var. siamensis (Kraenzl) N.Tanaka. The latter variety widespread in South and Southeast Asia, where it is supposed to have differentiated within the past few centuries. Cultivation. The species prefers light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and requires well-drained soil. The preferred soil is acid, neutral and basic (alkaline). It cannot grow in the shade and requires moist soil. It is hardy to zone 10 and is frost tender. In the north latitudes it is in flower from August to October, and the seeds ripen in October."

The Toronto Ontarios were a professional men's ice hockey team in the National Hockey Association from 1912 to 1915 based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They were first named the Tecumseh Hockey Club, renamed the Ontarios in 1913 and renamed the Toronto Shamrocks in January 1915 and ceased operations later that year. Tecumsehs. The NHA was founded in 1909 without any teams from Toronto, Ontario because there wasn't an arena in the city that was large enough to sustain a franchise. In 1911, a new arena was being built in Toronto and a franchise was awarded to the Toronto Hockey Club, and a group affiliated with the Tecumseh Lacrosse Club applied for a second franchise. The Tecumsehs bought a franchise from Ambrose O'Brien, paying $500 cash and promissory notes for $2,000. The Tecumsehs were put on the NHA schedule for the 1911–12 season with no home games scheduled until late in January, when the arena was expected to be completed. Because of construction delays, it soon became clear that the arena would not be ready in time, and both Toronto teams were removed from the schedule, leaving the NHA with only four teams for the season. Before the 1912–13 season started, O'Brien said that he never received the balance of the franchise fee from the Tecumseh backers, so he re-sold the franchise to a group headed by William James ""Billy"" Bellingham from Montreal, a former defenceman of the Montreal Victorias. Goaltender Billy Nicholson, formerly with Montreal HC, was appointed player-manager-captain. The team he put together included future hall-of-famer George McNamara and his brother, Howard McNamara. Teddy Oke, who would go on to be one of the founders of the Canadian Professional Hockey League in 1926, was also on the team. They played their first game on December 28, 1912 against the Montreal Wanderers at the arena, which would soon become known as Arena Gardens. The visiting Wanderers won 7–4 in front of 5,000 fans. Paid attendance of 4,339 and gate receipts of $3,040 both set short-lived Toronto hockey records. The Tecumsehs got off to a good start, but at the end of the season were in last place in the six-team NHA in with seven wins and 13 losses. Ontarios. In 1913, Tom Wall purchased the bankrupt Tecumsehs and renamed them the Ontarios. The team continued to play in the Arena Gardens. The Tecumsehs had finished sixth in the six-team league, with a record of seven wins and 13 losses. Despite the addition of 27-goal scorer Jack McDonald and veteran Ottawa Senators defenceman Fred Lake, the Ontarios fared worse, winning only 4 games and losing 16, for a.200 winning percentage. After one season, Wall sold the team to local amateur hockey impresario Eddie Livingstone. Livingstone acquired goaltender Percy LeSueur and forward Skene Ronan. He also added rookies Corb Denneny and Alf Skinner, and the McNamara brothers returned. The team had also acquired NHA scoring champion Tommy Smith before Livingtone took over. A tug of war developed over Smith's services. The Pacific Coast Hockey Association claimed Smith was their property; Livingstone, just as stubbornly, insisted he belonged to Toronto. The PCHA's bosses, Lester Patrick and Frank Patrick, threatened they would raid the NHA for players the next season. Shamrocks. After the first game of the season in January 1915, the team was renamed the Toronto Shamrocks. Livingstone said the idea came from the players because eight members of the team claimed Irish descent. The team colours were kept the same, but the O on the jerseys was replaced with a green shamrock. The Shamrocks finished the 1914–15 season with a record of seven wins and 13 losses, fifth in the league, ahead of only the Montreal Canadiens. Meanwhile, Toronto's other NHA club, the Toronto Blueshirts, had fallen from first place to fourth. On the west coast, the Patrick brothers announced an expansion team, the Seattle Metropolitans and the PCHA zeroed in on the Blueshirts' roster, signing many of their top players. Livingstone purchased the Toronto Blueshirts and owned two NHA teams but after the PCHA raids only had enough players for one team. He transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts, and only the Blueshirts competed in the 1915–16 NHA season. When Livingstone failed to sell the Shamrocks, the NHA seized the franchise, which was left dormant for the year. The National Hockey Association reactivated the abandoned Shamrocks franchise in 1916–17, awarding it to a Canadian military team, the Toronto 228th Battalion. The league became the National Hockey League the following season and neither of the Toronto NHA franchises were included in the new league. Season by season record.

52954562,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Colter,Fred Colter,"Abstract. Fred Tuttle Colter was an Arizona rancher and farmer, as well as being the state senator for Apache County beginning with Arizona's second state legislature in 1915. Colter spent six terms in the Arizona Senate. He also led the fight on Arizona's behalf to maintain control over the water from the Colorado River, coining the slogan, ""Save the Colorado for Arizona"". He was a close ally of the state's first governor, George W. P. Hunt. Prior to his election to the state senate, Colter had served as the state's fair commissioner. Early life. Fred T. Colter was born on February 2, 1879, in Nutrioso, Arizona, to James G. and Rosalia (""Rosa"") Colter. James was one of the original settlers of Apache County, Arizona, originally from Nova Scotia. James met and married Rosa in Springerville, Arizona, in 1877. Colter, Arizona, now abandoned, was founded and named after the elder Colter in 1872. Colter's family gave up their Arizona homestead due to hostilities with the Indians, after which they moved near Alma, New Mexico. While in New Mexico in 1881, the elder Colter was part of a group of 27 male settlers who held off an attack of approximately 300 Apaches, while the infant Colter was held by his mother in a storeroom. The settlers were rescued when U.S. Cavalry troops arrived. As a young man, he worked as a cowboy and rancher, even becoming the champion steer roper in Apache County. Colter worked as ranch hand and straw boss in the late 1890s and early 1900s. On November 11, 1904, at the age of 25, he married the forty year-old Sarah Dugan Phelps, known as ""Duge"". Duge had inherited her father's ranch, the Phelps Ranch, which was renamed after the marriage to Colter Ranch. The two left on a honeymoon trip, from which they returned in early December. Political activity. He served on the board of supervisors for Apache County from 1904 through 1912, along with Joseph Udall. A few months later, he purchased four lots of land on Central Avenue in Phoenix, on which he planned to build a winter home. In 1910 he was elected as a vice-president of the Arizona Cattle Growers Association, becoming the first person to hold that post. In 1910, he was nominated as the Democratic delegate to the Constitutional Convention for developing the state constitution for the soon-to-be state of Arizona. He was one of the two youngest members of the convention. While serving on the Constitutional Convention, he was made chairman of the committee on constitutional amendments. In this position he fathered a constitutional amendment for women's suffrage, which did not make it into the constitution. Governor Hunt appointed Colter to be the State Fair commissioner in February 1914, and in April 1914, Colter was one of the founding members of the Arizona Automobile Association, the first automotive group in the state. It would team up with the AAA. Later in 1914, Colter was elected to the first of six terms to the Arizona Senate. His election to the state senate necessitated his resignation as State Fair Commissioner in January 1915, prior to beginning his term as senator. By early 1915, Colter was already considered a strong contender to be the successor to Governor Hunt. In 1916, he was elected to be the National Committeeman for the Democratic Party from Arizona, becoming only the second person to have ever held that post, having succeeded Reese Ling, who he beat in a contentious vote by the Democratic central committee. Colter was the head of Arizona's contingent of six delegates, which included George Babbitt and James S. Douglas. The state's Democratic party pledged their support to Woodrow Wilson. Colter ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for his re-election to the state senate in 1916, and he was re-elected in November 1916 to a second term in the Senate. During the 1916 election, Colter was credited for being responsible for Wilson carrying the state by 13,000 votes. Efforts to control the water of the Colorado River. In 1920, Colter began a long effort to control the waters of the Colorado River. He began an effort to put construct a series of dams from southern Utah all the way down to Yuma, Arizona. The dams would store water, which would be used to reclaim over 6,000,000 acres of arid land through irrigation. The proposal was supposed to pay for itself through the sale of the power generated by the dams. In December 1921, the Arizona Fish and Game was formed, with Colter serving on its executive committee. In 1922, under doctor's orders, Colter booked an around-the-world cruise to recover his health. The itinerary of the trip included Hawaii, the Philippines, China, Japan, India and the mid-East. The trip was postponed when Colter learned of the Santa Fe Compact. He returned to Arizona and began a decades long fight to keep the lion's share of the water from the Colorado River for use in Arizona. In 1923, Colter founded the Arizona Highline Reclamation Association, the goal of which was to create a system of dams and reservoirs in the state, utilizing the waters of the Colorado. The concept also had the support of Colter's long-time political ally, Hunt, who had been re-elected as governor in 1922, defeating the man who had defeated Colter in the 1918 governorship race, Campbell. Early in 1924, Colter announced that he would be challenging incumbent Carl Hayden for his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Hayden was a proponent of the Santa Fe Compact, and this was seen as an internal struggle within the Democratic party in Arizona. However, for reasons unknown, Colter later withdraw from the race, although Hayden did tone down his support for the agreement. Colter coined the phrase, ""Save the Colorado for Arizona"", and he was the main reason that Arizona refused to sign the agreement as long as he was alive. He was compared as Arizona's counterpart to California's William Mulholland, as well as comparisons to Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson for his stance on Arizonians' rights to the water. Colter dedicated most of his efforts of the last two decades of his life to establishing the highline canal, committing not only his time, but the large fortune he had accumulated during the 1900s and 1910s. While ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the Santa Fe Compact from being signed by Arizona, the work of Colter, and his vision of a system of dams and canals to irrigate the arid regions of Arizona, would later form the basis for the Central Arizona Project of the 1960s and 1970s. Ranching/farming/mining activities. Colter, by the time he was 21 had created his own brand, the ""Cross Bar"". With his marriage to Duge in 1904, the homestead became known as the Colter Ranch. He brought an unknown number of his own cattle to the ranch, in addition to taking control of the 1100 head which were in Duge's herd, as well as over 800 he also managed for Elizabeth. By 1906 he had increased the herd to over 12,000 animals. Two years later, he had developed four reservoirs in the area: Colter, Mexican Hay Lake, Pool Corral, and Hog Wallow. He had also purchased another 3,500 acres extending the homestead's range, as well as up on the mesa to grow alfalfa feed. Mexican Hay Lake is still a popular fishing spot to this day. By the end of 1915 it was reported that several gold mining ventures to which he was a partner were beginning to bear fruit. These included two placer strikes on or near the White River in Tulare County. Ironically, one of the mining projects, that in which he partnered with John Marshall along the White River, was halted when local ranchers and farmers protested the plan to use the water from the river other than during flood stage. In addition to his large cattle herds, Colter also had extensive sheep flocks as well. By 1916, he held a large flock which grazed in Apache County during the summer months, and moved into Maricopa County, underneath the Roosevelt Dam during the winter months, where Colter had purchased extensive acreage to pasture his animals. The commissary he set up on the Colter Ranch was not only to serve the numerous ranch hands which worked his herds and flocks, but also served the surrounding ranches as well, becoming quite successful. By the end of 1917 the Colter Ranch, also known as the Cross Bar Ranch, after his brand, had grown into one of the largest in the state of Arizona. In 1919, Colter issued first mortgage bonds for $250,000, using 16,135 acres of his ranch as collateral, including 7,500 acres which were cultivated and irrigated, in order to pay off debts he had accumulated during his campaign for the governorship, as well as to provide him with extra funds to use on the ranch. At the time the acreage was appraised at $640,000. In October 1919, Colter sold a five-year lease for oil and gas exploration and development on his patented lands in the Holbrook oil fields in Apache County. Leaving his brother Bert to oversee his ranching concerns, Colter moved to Los Angeles in 1920, to bolster his weakening financial position, he founded the Northern Arizona Land Company, and increased the mortgage on his properties to $450,000 through a bond issuance. With his return to Arizona politics in 1922, Colter once again began splitting his time between Phoenix and his ranch in Round Valley. However, downward turns in the price of grain and beef left him in a sinking financial position. By 1924, creditors had already begun to foreclose on pieces of his large holdings. Combined with his continued financial commitment to the Highline Canal, he continued to lose more and more of the ranch, and by 1934, the entire property was owned by creditors, and Colter moved permanently to Phoenix. By 1944 Colter had lost all his money. On January 8, 1944, he was hit by a car in Phoenix, killing him."

27260042,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_(computer_security),Delegation (computer security),"Abstract. Delegation is the process of a computer user handing over its authentication credentials to another user. In role-based access control models, delegation of authority involves delegating roles that a user can assume or the set of permissions that the user can acquire, to other users. Types of delegation in IT networks. There are essentially two classes of delegation: delegation at Authentication /Identity Level, and delegation at Authorization /Access Control Level. Delegation at Authentication/Identity level. It is defined as follows: If an authentication mechanism provides an effective identity different from the validated identity of the user then it is called identity delegation atthe authentication level, provided the owner of the effective identity has previouslyauthorized the owner of the validated identity to use his identity. The existing techniques of identity delegation using sudo or su commands of UNIX are very popular. To use the sudo command, a person first has to start his session with his own original identity. It requires the delegated account password or explicit authorizations granted by the system administrator. The user login delegation described in the patent of Mercredi and Frey is also an identity delegation. Delegation at Authorization/Access Control level. The most common way of ensuring computer security is access control mechanisms provided by operating systems such as UNIX, Linux, Windows, Mac OS, etc. If the delegation is for very specific rights, also known as fine-grained, such as with Role-based access control (RBAC) delegation, then there is always a risk of under-delegation, i.e., the delegator does not delegate all the necessary permissions to perform a delegated job. This may cause the denial of service, which is very undesirable in some environments, such as in safety critical systems or in health care. In RBAC-based delegation, one option to achieve delegation is by reassigning a set of permissions to the role of a delegatee; however, finding the relevant permissions for a particular job is not an easy task for large and complex systems. Moreover, by assigning these permissions to a delegatee role, all other users who are associated with that particular role get the delegated rights. If the delegation is achieved by assigning the roles of a delegator to a delegatee then it would not only be a case of over-delegation but also the problem that the delegator has to figure out what roles, in the complex hierarchy of RBAC, are necessary to perform a particular job. These types of problems are not present in identity delegation mechanisms and normally the user interface is simpler. More details can be found at RBAC."

A person who commits an act of unfaithfulness toward his fellow man has thereby committed an act of unfaithfulness toward God. Every crime is a denial of God; for the criminal who is about to commit the crime denies that God has forbidden all unjust and immoral deeds (3:6). Talmud.

550752,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_cuisine,Punjabi cuisine,"Abstract. Punjabi cuisine is a culinary style originating in the Punjab, a region in the northern part of South Asia, which is now divided in an Indian part to the east and a Pakistani part to the west. This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking. History. The local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the agriculture and farming lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Dishes similar to tandoori chicken may have existed during the Harappan civilization during the Bronze Age of India. According to the archeologist Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest evidence for a dish similar to tandoori chicken can be found in the Harappan civilization and dates back to 3000 BC. His team has found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors that are used in the state of Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones with char marks have also been unearthed. Harappan houses had keyhole ovens with central pillars which was used for roasting meats and baking breads. Sushruta Samhita records meat being cooked in an oven (kandu) after marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab. Basmati rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it. Style of cooking. There are many styles of cooking in Punjab. In the villages many people still employ the traditional methods and equipment for cooking purposes. This includes wood-fired and masonry ovens. Modern methods include cooking on gas cookers. Tandoori style of cooking involves use of the tandoor. In India, tandoori cooking is traditionally associated with Punjab as Punjabis embraced the tandoor on a regional level. This style of cooking became popular throughout India after the 1947 partition when Punjabis resettled in places such as Delhi. According to Planalp (1971), ""the Panjab-style underground oven known as tandur is becoming increasingly popular in New Delhi"" pointing to the Punjabi style of the tandoor. In rural Punjab, it is common to have communal tandoors, which are also called Kath tandoors in Punjabi. Staple foods. Punjab is a major producer of wheat, rice and dairy products. These products also form the staple diet of the Punjabi people. The state of Punjab has one of the highest capita usage of dairy products in India. Therefore, dairy products form an important component of Punjabi diet. Dairy products are a staple in Punjabi cuisine. Both cow milk and water buffalo milk are popular. Milk is used for drinking, to add to tea or coffee, to make homemade dahi (yogurt), for butter and making traditional Punjabi cottage cheese called paneer. Traditionally, yogurt is made every day using previous day's yogurt as the starting bacterial culture to ferment the milk. Curd is used as dressing for many raita dishes, to prepare Kadhi, to prepare cultured buttermilk (Chaas), and as a side dish in a meal. Buttermilk is used in making various kinds of Lassi. It may also be used in curry preparations. Milk is also the prerequisite ingredient for butter and Ghee (clarified butter). Food additives and condiments. Food additives and condiments are usually added to enhance the flavor of the food. Food coloring as additive is used in sweet dishes and desserts. Starch is used as a bulking agent. Common dishes. Sweets and desserts. Punjabi cuisine includes various types of desserts and Mithyai which include: Bread. Punjabis eat a variety of breads. Flatbreads and raised breads are eaten on a daily basis. Raised breads are known as khamiri roti. Sunflower and flax seeds are also added in some breads occasionally. The breads may be made of different types of flour and can be made in various ways: Herbs and spices. Indian subcontinent-based spices are used in Punjabi cuisine, which are ground in a mortar and pestle or a food processor. Beverages. Punjab has a diverse range of beverages. Some are dairy-based such as lassi and buttermilk. Water buffalo milk-based products are especially common around Punjab. Examples are mango lassi, mango milkshake, and chaas. Others are juices derived from vegetables and fruits, such as watermelon shakes, carrot juice and tamarind juice (imli ka paani). Shikanjvi and neembu paani drinks are especially preferred during the summer. Jal-jeera is also common as well. Sattu is a traditional North Indian drink that is also traditionally consumed in the Punjab. Sattu is made by roasting barley grains and then grinding them into powder, mixed with salt and turmeric and water. The local regional drinks in Punjab also include Doodh soda (milk soda), Desi Daaru (a local form of alcohol in India) and Bantay (a local soda drink) in Pakistan. Fermented foods. Fermented foods are common in Punjabi cuisine. Also fermented foods are added in the preparation of some dishes as well. Mango pickle is especially famous in many villages of Punjab. Cooking methods. Traditional and modern methods are employed for cooking Punjabi cuisine. The traditional stoves and ovens used to cook Punjabi food include: Etiquette of Punjabi dining. Etiquette of eating is considered a major part of the cuisine. Every Punjabi household follows certain regional etiquette. The word etiquette has many local names depending on the particular region of Punjab. Though certain etiquette varies regionally, there are many etiquette practices that are common throughout Punjab. Communal dining is a norm in Punjabi families. Bringing and sending fresh fruits, sweets and food items as gifts to family members is a common practice in Punjab, particularly during the spring season. Food items are distributed among neighbors as well on special occasions and as a sign to show hospitality. Mango is considered a delicacy and produced widely in Punjab, and mango parties are common during the fruit's harvest season. Watermelon and radish at food stalls are shared among friends and relatives. Punjabi dhaba. The roadsides often serve as suburban eatery centers. They can also be a communal place to sit and chat. Some serve on the same concept of the greasy spoon. Punjabi Restaurants. Punjabi cuisine has spread internationally. Punjab in London has been family-run since 1946 and is the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant. The New Punjab Club, located in Hong Kong, became the world's first Punjabi restaurant to earn One Michelin Star in 2019."
36356286,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Lions_(album),The Young Lions (album),"Abstract. The Young Lions is an album by an ad hoc group of jazz musicians: Wayne Shorter, Frank Strozier, Lee Morgan, Bobby Timmons, Bob Cranshaw, Albert Heath and Louis Hayes. It was recorded at Bell Sound Studios in New York City in 1960 and released in 1961 on Vee-Jay Records. Album title. The album title echoes that of a popular 1948 novel by Irwin Shaw which had been made into a feature film shortly before the album was recorded. In the album's liner notes, saxophonist Cannonball Adderley uses Shaw's novel to make an argument about jazz. Adderley writes that there is a tension in modern jazz between tradition (as represented by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk) and the avant-garde (which at the time included Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor and Jimmy Giuffre), and suggests that conformity to either traditionalism or the avant-garde is stifling of ""true genius"": We are living the era of the glorification of mediocrity. These are the times when teenagers may become wealthy by writing and performing mediocre songs. When a scarcely-literate hillbilly with dubious talent may become a star with a million dollar income, or when an ""All American Boy"" type can spin records to which teenagers dance and become a major television personality. Many of us believe that such situations exist because we have allowed ourselves to conform to mass thinking and direction. The great novel by Irwin Shaw, The Young Lions, delivers several messages; among them, the parallel of conformity emanating from separate sources. One young man is a zealot in a community of conformist patriots who blindly follow a man bent on righting a situation that is wrong only in his ego-maniacal mind. The other young man is an unenthusiastic patriot in military service, who adheres to the ""Great American Ideal,"" which is itself conformity. Modern jazz today is standing on the threshold of destruction by those who would do it good. The lines are drawn and clearly marked. The traditionalists are those who unofficially feel that music introduced to us by Parker, Gillespie, and Monk has not been fully developed. The avant-garde feel that music is reactionary unless something ""different"" is either suggested or produced stylistically. Fortunately jazz making is highly personalized and true genius will not conform to direction. ""The Young Lions"" who made the music on this album have varied musical philosophies and sundry jazz backgrounds. The ""young lions"" phrase was revived in jazz in the 1980s when, as in 1960, there was a tension between the modern jazz traditionalists and the avant-garde. A group of young musicians including Wynton Marsalis who played neo-bop jazz were frequently referred to in the jazz press as ""young lions"". Notably, the phrase was used as part of the title of an Elektra/Musician album which featured Marsalis, The Young Lions (A Concert Of New Music Played By Seventeen Exceptional Young Musicians).

43472,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris,Nine men's morris,"Abstract. Nine men's morris is a strategy board game for two players dating at least to the Roman Empire. The game is also known as nine-man morris, mill, mills, the mill game, merels, merrills, merelles, marelles, morelles, and ninepenny marl in English. In North America, the game has also been called cowboy checkers, and its board is sometimes printed on the back of checkerboards. Nine men's morris is a solved game, that is, a game whose optimal strategy has been calculated. It has been shown that with perfect play from both players, the game results in a draw. The Latin word merellus means 'gamepiece', which may have been corrupted in English to 'morris', while miles is Latin for soldier. Three main alternative variations of the game are three, six, and twelve men's morris. Rules. The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections, or points. Each player has nine pieces, or men, usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two men (whereupon they can no longer form mills and thus are unable to win) or by leaving them without a legal move. The game proceeds in three phases: Strategy. At the beginning of the game, it is more important to place pieces in versatile locations rather than to try to form mills immediately and make the mistake of concentrating one's pieces in one area of the board. An ideal position, which typically results in a win, allows a player to shuttle one piece back and forth between two mills, removing a piece every turn. Variants. History. According to R. C. Bell, the earliest known board for the game includes diagonal lines and was ""cut into the roofing slabs of the temple at Kurna in Egypt""; he estimated a date for them of c. 1400 BCE. Friedrich Berger wrote that some of the diagrams at Kurna include Coptic crosses, however, making it ""doubtful"" that the diagrams date to 1400 BCE. Berger concluded: ""Certainly they cannot be dated."" However, these Coptic crosses themselves certainly are dated no earlier than 42CE according to Coptic Orthodox tradition, very near the end of the known architectural development of the temple. On the other hand, the earliest known board for the game certainly can be dated before the Common Era, as this article shall explain subsequently. One of the earliest mentions of the game may be in Ovid 's Ars Amatoria. In book III (c. 8 CE), after discussing latrones, a popular board game, Ovid wrote: There is another game divided into as many parts as there are months in the year. A table has three pieces on either side; the winner must get all the pieces in a straight line. It is a bad thing for a woman not to know how to play, for love often comes into being during play. Berger believes the game was ""probably well known by the Romans"", as there are many boards on Roman buildings, even though dating them is impossible because the buildings ""have been easily accessible"" since they were built. It is possible that the Romans were introduced to the game via trade routes, but this cannot be proven. The game might have been played by the sculptors while they were building the huge temples. Inscriptions are seen in many places, carved on stone. The game peaked in popularity in medieval England. A brick found on a mediaeval site near Wisbech, had been used by the brickmakers as a board before being fired.Boards have been found carved into the cloister seats at the English cathedrals at Canterbury, Gloucester, Norwich, Salisbury and Westminster Abbey. These boards used holes, not lines, to represent the nine spaces on the board—hence the name ""nine holes""—and forming a diagonal row did not win the game. Another board is carved into the base of a pillar in Chester Cathedral in Chester. Giant outdoor boards were sometimes cut into village greens. In Shakespeare 's 16th century work A Midsummer Night's Dream, Titania refers to such a board: ""The nine men's morris is filled up with mud"". Some authors say the game's origin is uncertain. It has been speculated that its name may be related to Morris dances, and hence to Moorish, but according to Daniel King, ""the word 'morris' has nothing to do with the old English dance of the same name. It comes from the Latin word merellus, which means a counter or gaming piece."" King also notes that the game was popular among Roman soldiers. In some European countries, the design of the board was given special significance as a symbol of protection from evil. Related games."
3055279,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Cyclops_and_Phoenix,The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix,"Abstract. The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix was a four-issue comic book mini-series written by Scott Lobdell, drawn by Gene Ha, and published by American company Marvel Comics in 1994. It revealed much of the back story for the character Cable, much of which had been implied before, but was still shrouded in mystery and uncertainty. The series' title characters are two of the founding members of the X-Men, a group of superpowered mutants dedicated to confronting the bigotry that afflicts their people, and stopping mutants with evil motives. They have regular adventures which fall into almost every subgenre of science fiction imaginable, including frequent encounters with time travel. Holocaust 's name was mentioned by Apocalypse in issue #4, a year before the character made its first actual appearance (first referred in Stryfe's Strike Files) in the ""Age of Apocalypse "" story arc. Back story. Shortly after Jean Grey (Phoenix) was believed dead, Cyclops (her longtime love interest, real name Scott Summers) met a woman who was almost her exact duplicate named Madelyne Pryor. Unbeknownst to either of them at the time, Madelyne Pryor was a clone of Jean Grey, created by Mister Sinister. Sinister was given vast powers by the virtually immortal mutant Apocalypse, but he feared Apocalypse's power and began to investigate a means to defeat him. He discovered that the combination of Summers and Grey's DNA would produce a mutant of sufficient power to do this. With Jean Grey apparently dead, and Sinister for some reason unable to combine their DNA artificially, he created Madelyne Pryor and positioned her to make contact with Cyclops. His plan worked: the two married and had a child, whom they named Nathan Christopher Summers. Some time later, Jean Grey was revealed to be alive, and her reappearance led to a series of events that caused Madelyne Pryor to become insane and eventually kill herself (as told in the Inferno crossover). The baby was left in the care of Cyclops and Jean, who were now part of the group X-Factor. Shortly after, X-Factor had an encounter with Apocalypse in X-Factor #68, and the villain infected the young baby with a Techno-Organic virus. The virus was rapidly converting his body into a machine, and had already consumed one of his arms. Unsure of what to do, at that moment a mysterious woman calling herself Askani appeared in front of them. She revealed that she was from the distant future, and had the means to save the child, but it would mean that they would likely never see him again. In reality, the child grew up to be the mutant Cable who had journeyed back into the past and who had appeared a few months before this event in New Mutants #87. Plot. The series takes place shortly after the wedding of Cyclops and Jean Grey in X-Men #30, some time after the events of X-Factor #68 (approximately 3 years in real time, but perhaps only a year or less in the timeline of the comic books). During their honeymoon, their time-lost alternate daughter, Rachel Summers who is then the Mother Askani, brought them into the future. Their physical bodies were left behind, but their minds were brought into two bodies waiting for them in the future. These bodies, very similar to the ones they had left behind, had weaker versions of their original powers. They were reunited with their son, and were given the opportunity to raise him in this bleak future that was ruled by Apocalypse. Prior to their arrival, the Mother Askani and the Askani clan attempted to save the baby Nathan from the TO virus. They first cloned the baby, fearing that they would fail in their efforts to save the original. They succeeded, however, and were left with two babies. The healthy clone baby was kidnapped by Apocalypse's forces to be raised by the villain, and was named Stryfe. Apocalypse thought the baby was the original, and had somehow survived the TO virus. Seeing this as a sign of strength (and his own body deteriorating), Apocalypse planned to transfer his essence into the young Stryfe once he reached maturity. The original baby was left behind, and was raised by Cyclops and Phoenix. As he began to grow, they protected him, and began to train him in the use of his vast, burgeoning telepathic powers, particularly how to use his telekenesis to keep the still present TO virus at bay. Their identity as his true parents (at least, genetically in Jean Grey's case) was kept a secret, and they instead went by the names Slym and Redd (these refer to Slim, a nickname Cyclops had picked up his younger years due to his slender frame, and Red, a common nickname for people with red hair, which Jean has sometimes been referred to over years, usually by Wolverine). All together, they spent 12 years raising Nathan Summers, who never knew they were his true parents. When the Mother Askani eventually died, their minds were brought back to their physical bodies, just after a combined effort of Slym, Redd and Nate finally defeating Apocalypse. Sequels. The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix was followed up by two other mini-series, Askani'son and The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix. Askani'son chronicled Cable's teenage years after Redd and Slym left, and his further struggles to become a man. The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix sees the two once again misplaced in time, this time back to the turn of the century, to be witness to the origin of Mister Sinister. Collected editions.

He became the head of the Beaumont faction in Navarre. He reportedly assassinated Felipe de Navarra, Marshal of the Kingdom, in 1479. In a treaty between the Navarrese monarchs and King Ferdinand II, Ferdinand promised to stop warring on Navarre or Béarn, Louis would hand over some strategic fortresses in exchange for new lands in Granada. However, when Louis refused to surrender the castle of Viana in 1506, the crown decided to crush the rebellious count for ever, restoring royal authority and patrimony. In December 1506 an army of 10,000 men led by Cesare Borgia and John III of Navarre besieged Louis in the Castle at Viana in Navarre, as he was an ally of Ferdinand II of Aragon.

35510806,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashemeji_derby,Mashemeji derby,"Abstract. The Mashemeji derby (English: Derby of the In-laws), also known as the Ingo-Dala derby, is the name of the local derby between two major association football teams in Kenya: A.F.C. Leopards and Gor Mahia. Both teams are currently based in the capital Nairobi, but originate from the Western region. It is the oldest rivalry in Kenyan football history. Fans of both A.F.C. Leopards and Gor Mahia (often referred to by their nicknames, Ingwe and K'Ogalo, respectively) recognize each other as arch-rivals. As of 2023, Gor Mahia has won the Kenyan Premier League a record 20 times, while A.F.C. Leopards have 12 league titles to their name. History. The two clubs have been bitter rivals since they first locked horns on 5 May 1968. In a match on 23 March 2012, Gor Mahia fans began to riot after midfielder Ali Abondo was given a red card following a dangerous tackle on Leopards' Amon Muchiri. Gor Mahia was banned by the Sports Stadia Management Board from using their facilities for the rest of the 2012 season (those being the Nyayo National Stadium and the Kasarani Stadium) as a result. This was also the reason for the postponing of their Round of 8 derby match in the 2012 KPL Top 8 Cup. Before that, on Heroes' Day 2011, Leopards fans had caused abandonment of an FKL Cup quarter final by pelting linesmen with objects after Gor Mahia went ahead with a superbly worked goal from a Moses Odhiambo and Moses Otieno combination which saw the former head in a superbly taken free kick by the latter. Leopards were made to forfeit the game and controversially escaped further bans despite the 1-0 scoreline being allowed to stand. Gor Mahia went on to memorably lift the Cup beating Sofapaka at the Nairobi City Stadium six days later and earn a right to represent Kenya in the 2012 CAF Confederation Cup. On 8 June 2014, the two teams faced off again in a Kenyan Premier League match at the Nyayo National Stadium. Having taken the lead in the 24th minute through Timonah Wanyonyi, Gor Mahia conceded the equaliser in the 35th minute when Charles Okwemba sent Jacob Keli through on goal, with Keli slotting home past keeper Jerim Onyango. A.F.C. Leopards had to wait until the second half to take the lead, when Okwemba was fouled by left back David Owino before heading the ball into the back of the net from an Abdallah Juma free kick. Bernard Wanyama sealed the victory for Ingwe in the 73rd minute, after chesting the ball down from an Okwemba lobbed through pass before hitting the cross bar and ending up in the back of the net. The defeat condemned Gor Mahia to their heaviest defeat that season until that point. Fans and hooliganism. The Gor Mahia fanbase is predominantly Luo while that of AFC leopards is mostly Luhya, making the rivalry partly tribal despite the significant support of ""neutrals"" (other communities or nationalities) for both clubs. The passion of the fans during encounters between the teams add to the intensity of the derby matches. Both teams have been involved in cases of hooliganism, but Gor Mahia fans are usually found on the wrong side of the law more often than their A.F.C. Leopards counterparts. After winning their 2013 FKF President's Cup semi-final against Sony Sugar, Gor Mahia fans began celebrating the win, with a huge number of them invading the pitch to attack Sony Sugar players. The incident resulted in Sony Sugar goalkeeper Wycliffe Kasaya being admitted to hospital. Only four days later, the fans attacked Sofapaka officials during a 2013 Kenyan Premier League match. They descended on the club's assistant coach Martin Ndagano and their medic Charles Omondi, forcing them out of the stadium, and making away with the latter's mobile phone in the process. During a 2014 Kenyan Premier League match against Thika United, A.F.C. Leopards fans descended onto the pitch in the 85th minute in frustration at their side's failure to come back from a 1–0 deficit. The incident cost A.F.C. Leopards the game, as the KPL handed Thika United a 2–0 win and handed A.F.C. Leopards a fine of KSh. 500,000/= to be paid by 20 June 2014."

643886,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Huntley,Chet Huntley,"Abstract. Chester Robert ""Chet"" Huntley (December 10, 1911 – March 20, 1974) was an American television newscaster, best known for co-anchoring NBC's evening news program, The Huntley–Brinkley Report, for 14 years beginning in 1956. Early life. Huntley was born in Cardwell, Montana, the only son and eldest of four children born to Percy Adams Huntley and Blanche Wadine (née Tatham) Huntley. The family was of Scottish descent. His father was a telegraph operator for the Northern Pacific Railway, and young Chet was born in the Cardwell depot living quarters. Owing to the railroad's seniority system, wherein employees with longer tenure could ""bump"" newer employees, the family moved often. They lived in Cardwell, Saco, Willow Creek, Logan, Big Timber, Norris, Whitehall, and Three Forks while he was a child. He graduated from Whitehall High School in Whitehall, and attended Montana State College in Bozeman, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He attended Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle before graduating from the University of Washington in 1934, with a degree in speech and drama. Career. Huntley began his radio newscast career in 1934 at Seattle 's KIRO AM, later working on radio stations in Spokane (KHQ) and Portland. His time (1936–37) in Portland was with KGW-AM, owned by The Oregonian, a Portland daily newspaper. At KGW he was writer, newscaster, and announcer. In 1937 he went to work for KFI in Los Angeles, moving to CBS Radio from 1939 to 1951, then ABC Radio from 1951 to 1955. In 1955, he joined the NBC Radio network, viewed by network executives as ""another Ed Murrow "". In 1956, coverage of the national political party conventions was a major point of pride for the fledgling broadcast news organizations. NBC News executives were seeking to counter the growing popularity of CBS ' Walter Cronkite, who had been a ratings success at the 1952 conventions. They decided to replace their current news anchor, John Cameron Swayze, but there was a disagreement on who the new anchorman should be. The two leading contenders were Huntley and David Brinkley. The eventual decision was to have both men share the assignment. Their on-air chemistry was apparent from the start, with Huntley's straightforward presentation countered by Brinkley's acerbic wit. This success soon led to the team replacing Swayze on the network's nightly news program. It was decided to have the two men co-anchor the show; Huntley from New York City, Brinkley from Washington, D.C. The Huntley-Brinkley Report began in October 1956 and was soon a ratings success. Huntley and Brinkley's catchphrase closing of ""Good night, Chet""—""Good night, David... and good night for NBC News"" was developed by the show's producer, Reuven Frank. Although both anchors initially disliked it, the sign-off became famous. Huntley and Brinkley gained great celebrity themselves, with surveys showing them better known than John Wayne, Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart or the Beatles. The gregarious Huntley remained the same, a friend commenting in 1968 that ""Chet is warm, he's friendly, he's unaffected, he's—well, he's just so damned nice."" In April 1956, before that year's political conventions that brought him to prominence, Huntley began anchoring a new half-hour program entitled Outlook, produced by Reuven Frank. The program aired for seven years, later changing its name to Chet Huntley Reporting, and often covered racial segregation and civil rights. In January 1962, the program moved from the Sunday evening news time-slot to prime time. Huntley wrote a memoir of his Montana childhood, The Generous Years: Remembrances of a Frontier Boyhood, published by Random House in 1968. He also became involved in a New York advertising agency, Levine, Huntley, Schmidt, Plapler & Beaver, gaining a 10 percent share in the agency in exchange for having his name on the letterhead and attending some agency meetings. He maintained his own cattle farm in Stockton, New Jersey, which for a short time in 1964 included a beef line from the farm's cattle promoted under his name before the network intervened due to conflict of interest and promotional concerns. Huntley's last NBC News broadcast was aired on Friday, July 31, 1970. He returned to Montana, where he conceived and built Big Sky, a ski resort south of Bozeman, which opened in December 1973. Marriage. Huntley's first marriage, to Ingrid Rolin, produced two daughters and ended in divorce in 1959. Later that year, Huntley, at age 48, married the former Tipton ""Tippy"" Stringer (1930–2010). Death. Huntley died of lung cancer on March 20, 1974, at his home in Big Sky at the age of 62, three days before the opening ceremonies for Big Sky. Huntley was honored with a cenotaph at Soldiers Chapel on the grounds of the Big Sky Resort. Boyne USA Resorts purchased the Big Sky Resort in 1976 and has owned and managed it since. Huntley was buried at Sunset Hills Cemetery in Bozeman, Montana, 50 miles east of his hometown of Cardwell, Montana. Accolades. In 1956 Huntley received the Alfred I. duPont Award. In 1988, Huntley was posthumously inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. Legacy. Only days before his retirement, Huntley gave an interview with Dick Cavett, available on the DVD The Dick Cavett Show: Rock Icons, Disc 2. On that broadcast, he described his political views as conservative on economic issues, but liberal on social issues. However, he stated to Cavett and the other guests that he took pains to ensure that his personal views did not adversely affect his reporting during his years as a journalist. In 2003, a biography titled Good Night Chet, by Lyle Johnston, was published by McFarland Publishers."

It is located in Shenyang, Liaoning province, China. History. The station opened in 1911. Shenyang North railway station was formerly the ""Liaoning main station"" (遼寧總站) before 1946 and colloquially known as the ""Old North Station"" (老北站). The original building was built in 1927. The current Main Station Building (主站房) began construction in 1986, was commissioned for operation in December 1990, and became one of the five most important railway hubs in China, earning itself the nickname ""Northeast's No. 1 Station"" (东北第一站).

Located in Hollywood, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) is a nonprofit exhibition space and archive of the visual arts for the city of Los Angeles, California, United States, currently under the leadership of Sarah Russin. History. In the mid-1970s, artists began living in large, inexpensive lofts built into the empty warehouses of downtown Los Angeles. LACE was initially located in the same area on Broadway, later moving to an industrial neighborhood near the Los Angeles River, and finally to Hollywood. Founded in 1978 by a group of thirteen artists and based upon principles of grassroots community organizing and social change, LACE committed from the start to presenting experimental works of art in all media, including the then-experimental media of performance art and video. In 1982, Joy Silverman was appointed the first executive director. LACE provided an early venue for artists like Laurie Anderson, Nancy Buchanan, Chris Burden, Gronk, Ishmael Houston-Jones, Mike Kelley, Martin Kersels, Linda Nishio, Paper Tiger TV, Adrian Piper, Judith Simonian, Johanna Went, David Wojnarowicz, Bruce and Norman Yonemoto, and Liz Young. The presence of performance art and video in major museums suggest that these experimental media are now part of the artistic canon and testifies to the success of LACE to promote these media to a wider audience. Originally located in Downtown Los Angeles, LACE moved to Hollywood in 1994. LACE has partnered with various organizations like YMCA, the Los Angeles LGBT Center, My Friend's Place, and Woodbury University. LACE also partners with other organizations including the Getty Museum, the Fellows of Contemporary Art, the California Institute of the Arts, the California College of the Arts in Oakland, Washington University in St. Louis, Kent State University, Atlanta College of Art, and Contemporary Art Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1998, LACE inaugurated Contemporary Editions LA, a fine-art publishing venture featuring Los Angeles-based artists, with editions in its first year by Paul McCarthy, Martin Kersels, and Sharon Lockhart. The following year, space published three new editions by artists Kevin Appel, Evan Holloway, and James Welling.

Ebenezer Pearson Dorr (13 March 1817 – 29 March 1881) was a merchant sailor, insurance executive, and meteorologist. Dorr was born in Hartford, Vermont. His earliest inclinations were for a seafaring life and when only ten years of age he sailed from Newburyport as a boy before the mast. In 1838, Dorr settled in Buffalo, New York, and became a sailor on the Great Lakes, serving as captain of several vessels. In 1843, Dorr became marine inspector for the Buffalo Mutual Insurance Company, and acted as agent of the New York board of underwriters for ""the entire northwest"" (the Great Lakes region). He was also for some time the Buffalo representative of many insurance companies, and served for seven years as president of the Board of Inland Underwriters. He was the first to organize a regular system of wreckage on the Great Lakes, and did much to improve the condition of seamen and to obtain recognition of their acts of heroism. Dorr was also a leader in Buffalo's business community. He acted at different times as president of the Board of Trade, the Society of Fine Arts, and the Historical Society of Buffalo, and as vice-president of the National Board of Trade. When the idea of systematic weather reporting was first suggested, Dorr took up the duty. At the request of Matthew Fontaine Maury, superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory, Dorr submitted daily meteorological observations from Buffalo, NY.

16528963,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_About_Me,Sweet About Me,"Abstract. ""Sweet About Me "" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Gabriella Cilmi from her debut album, Lessons to Be Learned (2008). The song was released as the album's second single on 10 March 2008 in the United Kingdom and on 24 March 2008 in Australia. One month later, it topped the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and stayed there for five non-consecutive weeks. ""Sweet About Me"" also became a hit in Europe, reaching number one in the Netherlands and Norway and becoming a top-five hit in eight other countries. In the UK, the song reached number six and was the most-played track of 2009 according to PRS for Music. The song won the Grand Prix during the 46th Sopot International Song Festival in 2009. A 2010 mix of ""Sweet About Me"" was included on Cilmi's second album, Ten, released in March 2010. Background. "" just sounds so fun, I imagine it playing in a bar. It'd be the perfect soundtrack for going on dates and playing footsies beneath the table. Or just going out and having fun!."" —Gabriella Cilmi, talking about her debut single ""Sweet About Me"". Recording of Lessons to Be Learned, the parent album of ""Sweet About Me,"" began in Melbourne, Australia, when Gabriella Cilmi was thirteen years-old. Cilmi then re-located to London, England in 2007 to launch her musical career and complete the recording of ""Sweet About Me"". The song was co-written by Cilmi in collaboration with its producers Xenomania, who are critically acclaimed for their work with Girls Aloud, Sugababes and Kylie Minogue. ""Sweet About Me"" was written after Cilmi was pillaging a Parisian record store for inspiration. Cilmi was listening to early psychedelic music around the time when she wrote the song. Lyrically, Cilmi said that the song is saying, ""We're all going to make mistakes, so we might as well have fun while we're making them."" Cilmi explained ""Sweet About Me"" to Bob Henderson of Gay Times, "" nothing being what it seems. This might sound cheesy as well, but just because I'm young doesn't mean I don't understand what's going on."" Described as a ""soulful pop song"" by contemporary critics, Cilmi revealed to Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul that the ""fun"" inspiration in ""Sweet About Me"" originated from her mother's love for 1970s British glam-rock bands, Sweet and T. Rex. During the recording of ""Sweet About Me"", Cilmi thought there was something ""amazing"" about the song. Speaking to WalesOnline she said, ""I thought it was like a nursery rhyme, the way it got stuck in your head."" Cilmi, who is influenced by rock bands Led Zeppelin and Kings of Leon, said she had to make a pop-sounding record to appeal to as many people as possible. Speaking to music website, The Digital Fix, Cilmi explained how she worked together with Brian Higgins on ""Sweet About Me"": Even though we came from two totally different backgrounds, when we worked together it just gelled. When it came to our differences I guess we both kind of compromised and came to a decision in the middle. Composition. ""Sweet About Me"" is a pop and swing jazz song. It utilizes a subtle electro beat, derived from rocksteady grooves interspersed with layered pop production, and ""retro-sounding"" contemporary themes. The song has received different lyrical interpretations from critics. A writer from Contactmusic.com felt the song refers to making trouble and getting away with it, Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the song sounds lyrically bitter, namely in the line. ""When you're playing with desire, don't come running to my place when it burns like fire boy'. According to Cilmi the lyrics are representative of having fun while making your mistakes, and learning from them along the way. ""Sweet About Me"" is written in the time signature of common time, with a beat rate of 132 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of C-sharp major. Cilmi uses a sweet and coarse vocal delivery which has been deemed as a misleading contrast between her mature sound and young age. Her vocal performance on the song is similar to that of a group act rather than that of a solo artist. She claims that the track's sound was a product of Xenomania 's pop music experience and her lyrical ideas. While the song was being crafted she was influenced by rock bands Kings of Leon and Jet, ""I wrote with who are totally different to me and came from a totally different musical background, they had worked with a lot of pop acts before and at the time I was listening to a lot of Jet and Kings of Leon, so when both our ideas met we came up with something pretty good."" Musically, the song has been compared to Amy Winehouse's 2007 single, ""Rehab "", for their similar composition, soul and swing musical influences. There are two versions of the song: the album version and the radio edit. The first verse is cut in half in the radio edit and the song opens up with the lyrics: ""Oh, watching me hanging by a string this time"" followed by ""Oh, easily climax of a perfect lie"". In the album version, there is a repetition of the first line followed by the line: ""Don't, easily a smile worth a hundred lies""; the radio edit omits these two lines before going into the pre-chorus. Critical reception. Nick Levine from Digital Spy positively reviewed ""Sweet About Me,"" giving it four out of five stars. Levine comended Xenomania 's production on the track, calling it ""authentic"" and ""fresh"". He also praised Gabriella Cilmi's vocals on the song, ""Most impressive of all is Cilmi's voice, which manages to be sweet and coarse all at the same time, much like a drizzling of honey on a slice of toast."" Jake Taylor of Sputnikmusic deemed ""Sweet About Me"" as one of the best songs released by an Australian artist on debut. He wrote, ""A lot of songs focus on the chorus as the returning point for the listener's attention, but 'Sweet About Me' dumps that for a well rounded mix of brilliant singing and layered pop production on all levels."" Contactmusic.com complimented ""Sweet About Me"" saying it brings a little fun back to pop. The song received a four-out-of-five star rating from Fraser McAlpine of the BBC, who compared Cilmi to British singers Amy Winehouse and Duffy, ""Perky song, this. Well suited to grabbing your attention even in the middle of the sudden run of post- soul sirens, largely because it swings a bit, and seems to have some spark of its own, rather than stiffly wearing its '60s influences like a pair of slightly-too-small cuban heeled boots."" Mark Reid of The New Zealand Herald described the track as ""incredibly catchy"". The song was classed as an obvious highlight on Lessons to Be Learned by Colin Polonowski of The Digital Fix. Andrew Cock of The Dwarf said that ""Sweet About Me"" is as catchy as ever and will continue to receive wide public acclaim. Cock noted, ""At times this song seems so sweet it oozes honey, feeling deliberately boppy."" Cilmi's vocal performance on the song was praised by Paul Cashmere of Undercover FM, ""From the sultry opening notes of the debut single 'Sweet About Me', the world will quickly come to know it's uncovered a major new vocal talent in Gabriella Cilmi."" Elisabeth Vincentelli from Time Out ranked ""Sweet About Me"" as the best song of 2008. Vincentelli wrote, ""Production team Xenomania crafted a typically ace tune for this 17-year-old Aussie, and her unassumingly sexy delivery brought it all home."" ""Sweet About Me"" was nominated in the category 'Most Performed Work' at the Ivor Novello Awards. The song won 'Single of the Year' at the 2008 ARIA Awards. Chart performance. On 14 April, the song topped the ARIA Singles Chart and is certified platinum for sales of 70,000 copies. It reached number one again on 19 May, where it sat for four weeks, while her debut album reached number two on the albums chart. This makes her the youngest Australian artist to reach the top of the charts, beating out Australian Idol winner Casey Donovan by just nineteen days. On 27 October 2008, ""Sweet About Me"" re-entered the Australian chart at number seventeen. The song would ultimately become the third highest-selling single of 2008 in Australia. On 9 March 2008, ""Sweet About Me"" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 68, rising to its peak position of number six on 21 June 2008 in its fifteenth week on the run. On 20 July, months after its release, the song reached number two on the UK Airplay Chart. On 2 August, the song managed to return to the Top Ten by climbing five spots from number twelve to number seven. However, the following week, the song fell back to number twelve, then eventually dropped out of the top 40 six weeks later. It re-entered the top forty on 5 October rising from number 65 to number thirty-eight. The song spent thirty-seven consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart before finally dropping out on 23 November. Cilmi recorded a performance of the song for a Christmas revival of the axed music show Top of the Pops, which aired on Christmas Day 2008 on BBC One.

9796250,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamfall_Chapters,Dreamfall Chapters,"Abstract. Dreamfall Chapters is an episodic 3D adventure game with emphasis on character interaction, exploration of the game world, and puzzle solving. It is a sequel to the adventure games The Longest Journey and Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. The game was released for PC in five episodes between 21 October 2014 and 17 June 2016. The updated ""Final Cut"" version was released on physical media for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 5 May 2017, and the Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux versions on 21 July 2017. The Longest Journey series is set in two parallel universes: Stark, a cyberpunk future Earth, and Arcadia, its magical fantasy counterpart. Chapters takes place in 2220 CE and continues the story of Dreamfall, whose protagonist Zoë Castillo had uncovered a criminal conspiracy that aimed to enslave both Stark and Arcadia by stealing their residents' dreams. Although Zoë managed to disrupt the conspirators' plans, she was betrayed and left in a coma at the end of Dreamfall, and has to find her purpose in life again in Chapters. The writers described the narrative theme of the game as ""chapters of life"". Dreamfall Chapters was developed by Red Thread Games, an independent studio founded by Ragnar Tørnquist, who wrote and directed the previous two games. Funcom, the owners of The Longest Journey IP, had licensed the rights to develop the next installment out to Tørnquist's studio. Its development was crowd-funded by a Kickstarter campaign that raised over $1.5 million, with additional funding provided by the Norwegian Film Institute. The publisher Deep Silver released the game on consoles in 2017 to mixed reviews. Gameplay. Dreamfall Chapters was originally developed on the Unity 4 game engine, but was retroactively upgraded to Unity 5 before the release of Book Four. It features large 3D environments, as opposed to 2D backgrounds in The Longest Journey and smaller 3D locations in Dreamfall. While not a completely open world, the game contains several free-roaming exploration levels, such as Europolis and Marcuria, and rewards players for exploring the levels and finding secrets. The locations themselves change slightly as the story progresses to reflect the passage of time. The player steers playable characters from an over-the-shoulder third-person view, using either the WASD keys and mouselook or a gamepad. Interactive characters and objects are highlighted on the screen, allowing the player to interact with them using the mouse and context menus. While the game supports game controllers, it was optimized for the PC. The gameplay focus is on the exploration of the environments and the story and on solving puzzles. Dialogue with NPCs and dialogue puzzles comprise about half of the gameplay time. The on-screen interface is hidden by default to improve the immersion. There is no combat or stealth gameplay in Dreamfall Chapters. Although the game features a linear plot with a set outcome, the players have to make many choices throughout the game that have far-reaching impact on the later story events (but not the ending). An optional, online-only ""social "" feature allows players to discover (either before, or after making the choice) which options other players (and their Facebook friends in particular) picked in these situations. These statistics are stored in a shared global database for all platforms. The game additionally displays a special ""The balance has shifted"" icon to warn players before plot-relevant choices, even when playing offline. An in-game journal, akin to April Ryan's diary in TLJ, keeps track of the recent plot developments. Plot. Development. Releases. Dreamfall Chapters was initially announced as an episodic video game, but this idea was scrapped in favor of a full-length game when the pre-production started in 2012, because the developers felt that extended breaks between chapters would have negatively affected the story flow and pacing. However, faced with mounting production costs, RTG decided in June 2014 to return to the episodic format, and the first ""book"", subtitled Reborn, was released on 21 October 2014. The subtitle of Book Two was announced on 26 November 2014. The subtitle of Book Three was announced on 22 May 2015, and its release date, one month later. Book Four's subtitle was announced via Twitter and Facebook in late September, and its release date, on 30 November 2015. The subtitle and the release date of the fifth and final Book was announced via Kickstarter on 6 April and 9 June 2016, respectively. Originally, the episodes were distributed digitally on platforms such as Steam, where the game was cleared on the Greenlight process on 17 April 2013. Individual episodes have never been sold separately, but only as part of a complete season pass. Munich -based EuroVideo Medien had released an exclusive retail PC version of the game in Germany in 2014, containing Book One and a Steam season pass key. After the release of the fifth and final episode, Red Thread Games started working on the updated and final version of the entire game. This version was released on 5 May 2017 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One by the publisher Deep Silver, and on 21 July for Windows, OS X, and Linux, where it was subtitled The Final Cut. A number of limited boxed editions were additionally offered as incentives to the supporters on Kickstarter, ranging from the simple Collector's Edition to the expansive ""Draic Kin Edition"", containing a variety of digital and physical bonus materials. These physical rewards shipped with the physical copies of The Final Cut. The master disc for the physical version was tested, approved, and sent into production in February 2018. Basic collector's editions have been shipped to backers throughout spring and summer 2018, but more expansive boxed editions could not be shipped before November 2019 due to delays in physical rewards production. The final batch of physical editions has been shipped to backers on 2 March 2020. Reception. According to the review aggregator website Metacritic, Dreamfall Chapters has received mixed or average scores from critics on PC and PlayStation 4, but ""generally favorable"" reviews on Xbox One. Ragnar Tørnquist reported in April 2019 that Dreamfall Chapters had performed ""very well"" commercially, with sales above 500,000 units. He noted that ""at least 50 per cent of the audience are women"", a percentage similar to that of The Longest Journey. Upon reviewing all five Books on PC for the Adventure Gamers website, Emily Morganti concluded that ""Chapters is worth playing to see how saga ends but doesn't hold up as a standalone adventure"".

The Representation of the People Act, 1951 is an act of Parliament of India to provide for the conduct of election of the Houses of Parliament and to the House or Houses of the Legislature of each State, the qualifications and disqualifications for membership of those Houses, the corrupt practices and other offences at or in connection with such elections and the decision of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with such elections. It was introduced in Parliament by law minister Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. The Act was enacted by the provisional parliament under Article 327 of Indian Constitution, before the first general election. Background. An elected constituent assembly was set up on 9 December 1946 to frame the constitution. Most of the articles of the constitution came into force on 26 January 1950, commonly known as the Republic Day. Part XXI of the constitution contained the transitional provisions. Articles 379 and 394 of Part XXI which contained provisions for provisional parliament and other articles which contained provisions like citizenship, came into force on 26 November 1949, the date on which the constitution was adopted. The provisional parliament enacted the Act vide Act No.43 of 1951 for the first general election conducted on 25 October 1951. The basic qualification to represent the people is Indian citizenship and not disqualified to vote under section 16 of the Representation of People Act, 1950 read with Part II and VII of this act. Amendments. The act has been amended several times, but some of the notable amendments include The Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2016 was introduced by Varun Gandhi in Lok Sabha. Application to constitutional offices. Registration of political parties is governed by the provisions of section 29A of this Act. Supreme court rulings and RPA. The Constitution of India – which empowers the Parliament of India to make laws regarding disqualification of MP and MLA- also mentions that on disqualification of an MP or an MLA, the seat becomes vacant immediately. Interpreting the words of constitution the bench found the clause 8(4) of the RPA act -which gives a time period of 3 months to file an appeal and allows continuation in office till its disposal- as unconstitutional. The Cabinet of Ministers, in order to nullify the judgement, passed an ordinance for the amendment of the act, however the said Ordinance wasn't signed by the President and it was taken back. A recent verdict on 19 November 2013 ensured the stay on the election campaigning of the convicted legislators for the current session. Some notable cases and instances. Provisions. The Act allows cash donations of any amount but it states in section 29C that any contributions above ₹ 20,000 (US$250) to political parties are to be reported."

30041666,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cruiser_Cond%C3%A9,French cruiser Condé,"Abstract. The French cruiser Condé was one of five Gloire -class armored cruisers built for the French Navy (Marine Nationale) in the early 1900s. Fitted with a mixed armament of 194-millimeter (7.6 in) and 164.7-millimeter (6.5 in) guns, the ships were designed for service with the fleet. Completed in 1904, Condé joined her sister ships in the Northern Squadron (Escadre du Nord). She was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron (Escadre de la Méditerranée) two years later, but rejoined the 2nd Light Squadron (2 Escadre légère), as the units based in northwestern France had been renamed, in 1912, together with two of her sisters. Condé was transferred to the Atlantic Division (Division de l'Atlantique) in early 1914 and protected French interests and citizens during the Mexican Revolution. She was still there when World War I began in August and spent most of the war unsuccessfully hunting for German commerce raiders. The cruiser was sent to North Russia in mid-1919 as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and covered the evacuation of Allied troops later that year. The ship was placed in reserve the following year and became a barracks ship two years later. In 1928 Condé became a training ship until she was hulked in 1933, although she continued to be used. The cruiser was captured during the German invasion of France in 1940 and was used as a depot ship until she was sunk in 1944. Her wreck was scrapped ten years later. Design and description. The Gloire -class ships were designed by the naval architect Emile Bertin as enlarged and improved versions of the preceding Gueydon class. The ships measured 139.78 meters (458 ft 7 in) overall, with a beam of 20.2 meters (66 ft 3 in) and a draft of 7.55 meters (24 ft 9 in). They displaced 9,996 metric tons (9,838 long tons). Their crew numbered 25 officers and 590 enlisted men. The sisters' propulsion machinery consisted of three vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller shaft, using steam provided by water-tube boilers, but the types of machinery differed between them. Condé had three-cylinder engines fed by 28 Niclausse boilers that were designed to produce a total of 20,500 metric horsepower (15,100 kW) intended to give her a maximum speed of 21 knots (39 km/h; 24 mph). During her sea trials on 11 May 1904, the ship reached 21.31 knots (39.47 km/h; 24.52 mph) from 22,331 metric horsepower (16,424 kW). The cruisers carried enough coal to give them a range of 6,500 nautical miles (12,000 km; 7,500 mi) at a speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). Construction and career. Condé, named after Louis, Grand Condé, was authorized in the 1896 Naval Program and was ordered from the Arsenal de Cherbourg on 17 September 1898. The order for the ship was transferred to the Arsenal de Lorient on 8 April 1898 where she was laid down on 29 January 1901, after her sister Gloire vacated the slipway. Condé was launched on 12 March 1902, and completed on 12 August 1904. The cost of her construction was 21,594,975 francs. The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Division (1 Division de croiseurs) of the Northern Squadron; together with her sisters Gloire and Amiral Aube, Condé escorted the remains of John Paul Jones from France to Annapolis, Maryland, and then went on to visit New York City. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron's Light Squadron in 1906. By June 1910, after a reorganization that saw the Mediterranean Squadron redesignated as the 1st Squadron (1 Escadre) and the Light Squadron split in half, Condé and her sisters Gloire and Amiral Aube were assigned to the 2nd Light Division (2 Division légère (DL)). As more modern armored cruisers entered service, they were concentrated in the Mediterranean and Condé and Gloire joined their sister by January 1911 in the Cruiser Division of the 2nd Squadron, as the Northern Squadron had been redesignated. In March the sisters visited New York City. When the Danton -class battleships began entering service in August, the French Navy reorganized yet again with the 2nd Squadron renumbered as the 3rd and the Cruiser Division was renamed as the 3rd DL. After the Agadir Crisis of 1911, the French and British governments agreed in 1912 that the Royal Navy would defend the northern French coast and the French would concentrate their fleet in the Mediterranean and defend British interests there. The French forces left in the north were consolidated into the 2nd Light Squadron with the 3rd DL redesignated as the 1st Cruiser Squadron. Condé was transferred to the Atlantic Division, based in the French West Indies, in early 1914. During the United States occupation of Veracruz beginning in April 1914, the cruiser was frequently off the coast of Mexico to protect French citizens and interests during the Mexican Revolution."

Chang which traces the life of the Japanese musician Hisao Shinagawa through his early years as a folk singer in Tokyo to his current occupation as a street performer in Los Angeles. The film was shot from 2004 to 2006, and provides a unique insight into the influence of Western popular music on the teenage youth culture of 1960s Japan, as well as an inside look at Shinagawa's struggle to survive as a songwriter after losing his recording contract in the 1980s. The title of the film comes from an off-hand comment Shinagawa makes about wanting to destroy the U.S. system. In his review of the DVD release, critic John Wallis notes, ""I Want to Destroy America is formatted with Hisao speaking for himself. Interview audio and footage is placed over still and stock footage and the modern footage, some of it fly-on-the-wall, some of it atmospherically staged,"" and concludes that the film is an ""interesting portrait of an outsider artist who has lead an amazing life.

Yahara Elementary in DeForest, Wisconsin, opened for the 1992–93 school year. In March 2002, 340 students at Yahara Elementary (Deforest, Wisconsin) were sent home on accordance to an issue with excessive moisture in the building causing toxic mold to grow in the ventilation ducts, pipes, and on carpets. Three teachers, a custodian, and a student were suffering with respiratory problems and were insistent on taking the company, J.H. Findorff & Son, Inc. to court because they believed the mold issues were a product of the school having been built improperly. Two of the teachers a custodian and a student were involved in the lawsuit. Trial court. On August 20, 2002, the plaintiffs sued Findorff in Dane County under the safe place statute and in strict liability alleging the defects in the original design and in construction that caused the excess moisture. The circuit court concluded that the plaintiffs discovered the cause of their symptoms more than three years before filing this suit making their claims time-barred. The plaintiffs claims under the safe place statute failed because the information submitted did not show that Findorff had custody or control of the area, the negligence claims failed too because none of their witnesses offered standard care opinions regarding Findorff. The plaintiffs then appealed the decision. Decision. In April 2005, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reversed the lower court in an opinion written by judge Dykman. The decision stated, in regards to the statute of limitations, that when the symptoms were discovered to be caused by the HVAC system was a question of fact that must be determined by the jury. As to the standard of care on the negligence claim, the court said that plaintiffs had submitted deposition testimony from an expert that could be used to establish the standard of care.

2094387,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_TX81Z,Yamaha TX81Z,"Abstract. The Yamaha TX81Z is a rack-mounted (keyboard -less) frequency modulation (FM) music synthesizer, released in 1987. It is also known as a keyboard-less Yamaha DX11 (and the subsequent Yamaha V50 (music workstation)). Unlike previous FM synthesizers of the era, the TX81Z was the first to offer a range of oscillator waveforms other than just sine waves, conferring the new timbres of some of its patches when compared to older, sine-only FM synths. The TX81Z has developed a famous reputation, largely based on some of its preset bass sounds. The Yamaha DX11 keyboard synth was released the following year, offering improved editing abilities. Features. The unit is multitimbral, and has 128 ROM voices, 32 editable voice slots, and 24 editable Performance memories. The RAM slots were rarely utilized due to the perceived high quality and usability of the original patches and the difficulty of programming new sounds with the limited front-panel interface. Among the presets is the famous LatelyBass, one of the most popular presets in synthesizer history. The TX81Z is backwards-compatible with sound patches developed for Yamaha's DX21, DX27, and DX100 synthesizers. It is also very similar, and almost completely patch-compatible, to the DX11 synthesizer, which is essentially a TX81Z with a velocity and pressure-sensing keyboard and a pitch envelope. Usage. Some say the prevalence of the TX81Z's presets was also because of the difficulty in creating new patches. Creating new sounds from the unit's front panel is possible, but numerous nested parameters must be navigated by way of 11 buttons and a backlit 16 character, 2-line LCD. However, several personal computer-based editing applications have been developed since its release. The Dutch company KissBox released in 2013 a TX81Z editor based on RTP-MIDI communication, which makes the hardware synth appear as a VST plugin, while being controlled over a network link in real-time. The TX81Z was designed as a low-cost FM machine and has always been relatively inexpensive compared to most other FM synthesizers. The TX81Z is built around a single FM chip, the Yamaha YM2414B aka OPZ, while 6-op machines like the DX7 have separate envelope/frequency and algorithm/wave chips and created LFOs in software; this large workload in the OPZ is probably why it has fewer operators and notes. A 63B03 CPU allocates voices and generates auxiliary LFOs, in parallel with MIDI and user interface, which might be why e.g. a pitch EG was omitted; the later DX11 splits responsibilities between 2 CPUs and adds a PEG. The low price made the TX81Z popular with many producers on a tight budget, and is still used by part-time house and acid house producers. Eliot Kennedy uses it for one purpose, a ""classic dancefloor bass sound."". Producer Babyface at one point had two units in his studio, both of which he kept set to the preset ""LatelyBass"", one detuned from the other; this expanded version of the preset became a part of his signature sound. TX81Z is very suitable for accordion use. It can be programmed to give Four Notes Right, Three notes Chord and One Note Bass. The machine can replicate the sounds of the old style Cordovox as well as add some further interesting sounds."
59766624,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Employee_Fair_Treatment_Act_of_2019,Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,"Abstract. The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (GEFTA) is a United States federal law which requires retroactive pay and leave accrual for federal employees affected by the furlough as a result of the 2018–19 federal government shutdown and any future lapses in appropriations. The Act is an amendment to the Anti-Deficiency Act, which governs federal procedures during a lapse in annual appropriations. Background. When a United States federal government shutdown occurs, affected federal employees are considered either ""excepted"" or ""non-excepted"". Excepted federal employees must continue to work, generally because their work is considered essential to preservation of life or property. These employees work without receiving pay, and were not permitted to use paid leave, until their agencies are funded, but were already guaranteed their back pay. In addition, other federal employees not affected by the shutdown are considered exempt for various reasons (such as not being funded by annual appropriations) and receive regular pay and benefits. Prior to 2019, non-excepted employees were furloughed without guarantee of pay unless Congressional action provided compensation for lost wages and accrued leave. In past shutdowns, retroactive pay and leave has always been provided for furloughed employees through legislation passed after that shutdown, even though it was not guaranteed. Typically, the legislative package ending the shutdown included this language; for example, in the January 2018 shutdown, retroactive pay and leave was part of the continuing resolution which funded the government again. Legislative history. Prior to the start of the US federal government shutdown in December 2018, both the House and Senate had seen bills proposed that would provide back pay for federal employees. However, these were not adopted before the 115th Congress ended its session, and so new versions were required to be reintroduced in 2019. The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 was proposed during the shutdown's third week, and was signed into law within two weeks after that after overwhelming, bipartisan support in Congress. The bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Ben Cardin as S. 24 on January 3, 2019 with 30 cosponsors. On January 10, 2019, it was passed by the Senate unanimously, in a voice vote. The next day, the House of Representatives held debate on the bill, and then passed the Senate bill without amendment in a roll call vote. The House vote was 411–7, with 16 non-votes. The small amount of opposition nevertheless received media attention because it was a break from previous back pay votes, such as during the 2013 shutdown, which were unanimous. The 7 opponents of the bill in the House were all fiscal conservatives associated with the House Freedom Caucus, several of whom, such as Representatives Justin Amash and Andy Biggs, argued that the bill's provisions should be limited only to the ongoing shutdown, so as not to incentivize future shutdowns. On January 16, the bill was signed into law by President Trump, who had already indicated support for it before the Senate vote occurred. Provisions. The most significant change introduced by the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act was that it applies to ""any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018"". This means that in addition to the 2018–19 shutdown, the Act ends the uncertainty employees would have faced about back pay in any future shutdowns. The Act requires that furloughed employees receive retroactive wages for the length of a shutdown at the standard rate of pay. It also requires that excepted employees working without pay receive retroactive pay for work performed. In addition, the Act grants excepted employees permission to use their paid leave, and to receive standard compensation for leave taken. It is further specified that this back pay is to be received at the earliest possible date after the end of a shutdown, so that employees would not need to wait until a scheduled pay day. The provisions of the law cover affected District of Columbia employees, in addition to federal government employees. While D.C. government employees were not furloughed during the 2018–19 shutdown, they had been affected before in past shutdowns. Implementation. After being signed into law, the Act went into force immediately, applying to the shutdown that began in December 2018, as well as all future shutdowns. On January 23, 2019, the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees US federal human resources policy, issued Compensation Policy Memorandum 2019-04, a memorandum to federal agencies containing details for implementation of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act. Related legislation. In discussing the Act's passage, many commenters noted that it provides relief only to government employees. The many contract workers—especially low-wage, hourly workers—facing financial hardship during a shutdown have traditionally never been awarded compensation for lost wages.

Atlante is an Italian banking sector owned bail-out equity fund that is dedicated to recapitalize some Italian banks, as well as purchase the securities of the junior tranches of non-performing loans. It was established in 2015 in response to the Italian bad debt crisis of that year. The fund was under regulation by the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. According to Federico Ghizzoni, former CEO of UniCredit, although the bank may inject €1 billion to the fund, the bank had a priority to sell their bad loan to the fund. UniCredit had about €20 billion net value of bad loans on the balance sheets as of 31 December 2015. Moreover, both UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo (via Banca IMI) were already underwritten Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca for a combined €2.5 billion capital increase. The contributions of the fund would make the fund become the buyer of the unsold shares, instead of the banks themselves. As BPVi announced that the new shares would be priced between €3 and €0.1 per share, the fund on behalf of UniCredit would purchase the unsold share for €0.1 only. It was reported that banking foundations, such as Fondazione Cariplo, Fondazione Cariparo, Compagnia di San Paolo and Fondazione CRT, which in previous banking reforms were forced to sell their banking subsidiaries (forced to diversify investments), were invited to invest in the fund. According to ACRI, the foundations had €40 billion shareholders' equity, with most of them no longer owning their banks in majority or entirely sold. Fondazione Cariplo, a shareholder of Intesa Sanpaolo and the management firm of the fund, had a shareholders' equity of €8.9 billion.

30797,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarja_Halonen,Tarja Halonen,"Abstract. Tarja Kaarina Halonen (pronounced; born 24 December 1943) is a Finnish politician who served as the 11th president of Finland, and the first and to date only woman to hold the position, from 2000 to 2012. She first rose to prominence as a lawyer with the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), and as the Prime Minister 's parliamentary secretary (1974–1975) and a member of the City Council of Helsinki (1977–1996). Halonen was a Social Democratic Party member of parliament from 1979 until her election to the presidency in 2000. She also served as a minister at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health from 1987 to 1990, as Minister of Justice from 1990 to 1991, and as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1995 to 2000. Halonen was an extremely popular president, with her approval ratings reaching a peak of 88 percent in December 2003. She was re-elected in 2006, defeating National Coalition Party candidate Sauli Niinistö in the second round by 51% to 48%. Ineligible to run in the 2012 presidential elections because of term limits, Halonen left office on 1 March 2012 and was succeeded by Niinistö. Widely known for her interest in human rights issues, Halonen served as the chairperson of the Finnish LGBT rights organization Seta in the 1980s, and she actively participated in the discussion of issues such as women's rights and the problems of globalization during her presidency. In 2006, she was mentioned by various commentators as a potential candidate for the United Nations Secretary-General selection, but she denied an interest at that time, stating that she wanted to finish her term as president before thinking about other career options. In 2009, Forbes named her among the 100 most powerful women in the world. Halonen is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development. Since the death of Martti Ahtisaari in 2023, Halonen is currently the oldest living former president of Finland. Early life and career. Tarja Halonen was born on 24 December 1943 in the district of Kallio, which at the time was a traditional working-class area in central Helsinki. Her mother Lyyli Elina Loimola was a set-dresser and her father Vieno Olavi Halonen worked as a welder. Halonen's parents married at the beginning of World War II and Tarja was born a few years later. Vieno Halonen was at the frontline during the Continuation War and Lyyli Halonen was working in a shoe factory when their daughter was born. When Halonen was two years old, her father Vieno Halonen went to the kiosk to buy a magazine and no longer returned home to his family. Halonen has not commented much on the incident since, but Halonen's parents officially divorced in 1948. Vieno Halonen was an award-winning soldier who fought in the 26th Infantry Regiment, so-called Ace Regiment. Vieno Halonen was wounded three times during the war and after the war he was awarded first, second and fourth class Order of the Cross of Liberty medals. In later interviews, Tarja Halonen has said that she has met her father only a few times. After the divorce, in 1950, Lyyli Halonen married her new husband Thure Forss, who worked as an electrician and was very active in the working-class community. Both Halonen's mother and her stepfather influenced her world view extensively. Halonen later said that her mother was a true survivor, always an extremely active and resilient person who valued good, honest and modest hardworking people. When she entered politics, Halonen stated that these are also the qualities and attributes she respects in people. In 1950 she began her studies in Kallio Elementary school from where she later moved to Kallio Gymnasium and finally finished her matriculation examination in 1962. She began to study Art History in the University of Helsinki in 1962 but in autumn 1963 she changed her studies to law, and obtained her Master of Laws degree in 1968 specializing in criminal law. She began to work as a lawyer, already before obtaining her degree, in a credit surveillance company Luotonvalvonta oy in 1967. After working there for a few years, she was hired by the National Union of University Students in Finland to work as a Social Affairs and General Secretary from 1969 to 1970. Her work in the Union spurred her interest in politics, and in 1970 she obtained a post as a lawyer in the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions, being the first female ever to work as a lawyer in the Union. Political career: 1970–2000. Presidential campaign. Presidency. Political views. Early in her political career Halonen represented the far-left wing of the SDP. She publicly opposed the proposed free trade agreement of the European Economic Community in 1973, by signing a petition along with 500 other prominent social democrats and socialists. Otherwise she was loyal to President Kekkonen 's foreign policy, which was founded on Finnish neutrality and good relations with the Soviet Union. Markku Salomaa's 2021 book Tarza – Pasifistin odysseia voimapolitiikan maailmassa states that Chancellor Angela Merkel had a very negative attitude towards Halonen, precisely because of her pro-Soviet and far-left wing world of ideas. Since 2004, rumors have been circulating on Internet that Halonen gave a May Day speech at Hakaniemi Market Square in 1976 and hoped that Finland would join the Soviet Union, saying: ""Finland would be blessed to join the Soviet Union by peaceful means. At the same time, we would get rid of the yoke of capitalism, because capitalism will die in 20 years. Finland, together with the Soviet Union, could be a pioneer towards a communist society."" In an interview with STT, Halonen herself has completely rejected the gossip, saying: ""I have not given any May Day speech in Hakaniemi in 1976, nor can the text be found in the Informant. And if a Social Democrat SAK lawyer had given such a May Day speech in the 1970s, the employment relationship would have been rather short."" Throughout her political career, Halonen has described herself as a supporter of ""international solidarity"". She describes herself as a ""relative pacifist"", meaning that she does not support unilateral disarmament. She has strongly defended the President's role as the commander in chief of the military. She opposed NATO membership during her tenure. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Finnish public opinion had turned, and the Parliament had debated the issue and decided, in favor of submitting an application for NATO membership, Halonen also voiced her support on Twitter, calling the move ""a necessary measure in the changed security situation in Europe"". Her strong stands on these issues have characterised her presidential term and shaped Finnish foreign policy, in part in cooperation with the like-minded former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Erkki Tuomioja. Halonen has publicly supported the involvement of the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) in politics. The Constitution of Finland and Halonen's decision to take part in some European Union meetings with the Prime Minister has created the so-called ""problem of two dinner plates"" in Finland. Since most other countries only have their Prime Ministers representing them, it was also decided in Finland that the task is reserved for the Prime Minister in most cases. On 20 March 2013, Halonen publicly voiced her support for same-sex marriage. Personal life. President Halonen says her interests include art history, the theatre and swimming. She says she speaks Finnish, Swedish, and English, and is studying Estonian. Halonen had two cats during her presidential term. After they died, she was given a Neva Masquerade cat in 2013 by Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev. On 26 August 2000, President Halonen married her longtime partner, Dr. Pentti Arajärvi, in a civil ceremony at her official residence, Mäntyniemi, after a relationship of more than fifteen years. Halonen's adult daughter Anna, and Arajärvi's adult son Esko, acted as witnesses. Both children are from previous relationships. She promotes Finland in her personal accoutrements, such as wearing a Moomin watch. In the 1960s, she left the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, to which the majority of Finns belong, to protest against its policy of taxing church members and its stance against female priests. The church has since accepted women as priests, and Halonen has stated that she has no personal reason not to return to the church but refrains from doing so in order not to give a signal that might be misinterpreted. In the 1990s, Halonen acted as the chairman of Suomen setlementtiliitto, a Christian social work organization. After her presidential term, Halonen rejoined the Evangelical-Lutheran Church. According to her statements, she had previously refrained from it as it might have been considered an attempt to garner political support. Since then, Halonen has even preached publicly in a divine service of her home parish of Kallio. This is a privilege that the parish priest may grant only in exceptional cases to persons known for their Christian conviction. In 1980–1981 Halonen served as the chairman of Seta, the main LGBT rights organization in Finland. Positions. Criticism. Halonen was criticized on her views that the Covid-19-pandemic was handled better in countries with female leaders. Former Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Finnish author Sofi Oksanen have been strongly criticizing Halonen for her over-optimistic views about Putin and unwillingness to publicly condemn Russia’s hostilities in the neighboring countries, e.g. when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, Halonen publicly belittled President Ilves’s concerns of the negative geo-political development being just ”Post Sovietal stress”. Even when Russian army invaded Ukraine, Halonen kept quiet. Honours and awards. In popular culture. A long-running joke, which stems from the recurring segment ""Conan O'Brien Hates My Homeland "", is that American talk show host Conan O'Brien resembles Tarja Halonen. After joking about this for several months (which led to his endorsement of her campaign), O'Brien travelled to Finland, appeared on several television shows and met President Halonen. The trip was filmed and aired as a special. Halonen also appears as an animated character in the political satire TV series The Autocrats."

Deno John Geanakoplos (Greek: Κωνσταντίνος Γιαννακόπουλος) was a renowned scholar of Byzantine cultural and religious history and Italian Renaissance intellectual history and the Bradford Durfee Professor Emeritus of Byzantine History, Renaissance History, and Eastern Orthodox Church History at Yale University. He was the author of 13 books and over 100 articles and was considered one of the foremost Byzantine scholars in the world. He was the father of Yale Economist and Professor John Geanakoplos. Early life and education. Geanakoplos was born in 1916 in Minneapolis, Minnesota to parents of Greek ancestry. He studied music before becoming a historian. He earned a diploma in violin from the Juilliard School of Music in 1939 and then played in the first violin section in the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra under Dimitri Mitropoulos. Simultaneously, he pursued a B.A. in history from the University of Minnesota, receiving it in 1941. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Army with a school friend, Sydney Ahlstrom, both of whom eventually became history professors at Yale. Geanakoplos was sent to North Africa, where he learned French, and then was in the first wave of American soldiers to reach Sicily, where he learned Italian. Becoming increasingly interested in Italian culture, he managed to enroll and complete the Dottore in lettere at the University of Pisa in 1946, writing his dissertation in Italian. Leaving the Army as a captain, he returned to the symphony and the University of Minnesota, where he was awarded an M.A. in 1946. He enrolled in the Graduate School of Harvard University in 1947, completing his Ph.D. in history in 1953, meanwhile serving as concertmaster of the Harvard-Radcliffe Symphony Orchestra. Career. Professor Geanakoplos’s first teaching positions were at Brandeis University and at the Greek Theological Seminary in Boston. From 1954 to 1967, he taught medieval history at the University of Illinois, before joining the faculty at Yale, where he remained until his retirement in 1987. After his son John joined the Yale economics faculty in 1980, they became only the third father-son pair to be tenured professors concurrently in the university’s history. Deno Geanakoplos was elected president of the American Society of Church History in 1983 and was a fellow of the Medieval Academy of America, the American Historical Association and the Renaissance Society of America. In 1975 he was awarded the title of Archon “Teacher of the People” by the Patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church in Constantinople. Geanakoplos's numerous books include: Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West, 1258-1282: a study in Byzantine-Latin relations (Harvard University Press, 1959), Greek scholars in Venice: studies in the dissemination of Greek learning from Byzantium to Western Europe (Harvard University Press, 1962), Byzantium and the Renaissance: Greek scholars in Venice: studies in the dissemination of Greek learning from Byzantium to Western Europe (Archon Books, 1973), Interaction of the ""sibling"" Byzantine and Western cultures in the Middle Ages and Italian Renaissance: (330-1600) (Yale University Press, 1976), Medieval Western Civilization and the Byzantine and Islamic worlds: Interaction of three cultures (D.C.

His research showed the pivotal role that Byzantine scholars who emigrated to Italy played in unlocking and interpreting ancient Greek texts vital to the Italian Renaissance, systematically documenting their interactions in the West. He deeply probed the encounters between the Greek and Roman churches over centuries of recurring schism and attempted reunion, including the Councils of Lyons, Basel and especially Florence, during which the churches agreed to reconcile. Personal life. His brother Christie John Geanakoplos, who died in 2005, was professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota. He was married to Effie Geanakoplos, a clinical social worker and instructor in psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center, for 48 years. She predeceased him in 2001.

Her glorious voice cascades over stunning soundscapes that dance the fine line between intimate and cinematic."" Josh Leeson of The Newcastle Herald said: ""Sugar Mountain is at once intensely emotional and a shiny fabrication. It's taken... five years to build this songbook which aims to paint an alternate childhood from her own, which was marred by the death of her 11-year-old sister."". Triple J said: ""Each song takes you into a melancholic pastel dream, recalling musical influences of her formative teenage years. You can hear the folk tinges of Neil Young and Joni Mitchell taken from her parents' record collection alongside the self-navigated discoveries of gritty guitars and power-pop hooks"". Tim Lamber from Stack Magazine said ""If you look only at Sugar Mountain through the sparkling, rose-coloured glasses that River has draped over the album, you might not be rewarded with uncovering the confidential and vulnerable world she has created – but which she is encouraging you to discover."" Tina Odukoyat from Never Enough Notes said: ""The electropop album, inspired by her favourite Neil Young song, includes intense guitar motifs, heavy drum riffs and crystal clear vocals, all perfectly apt for a glitter filled festival headliner spot."" He added, ""Sugar Mountain is a personal and bold debut album that laments River's lost youth, yet simultaneously oozes a glowing sense of hope. It's a record that deserves to be performed on a big festival stage in all its sparkly and glittery glory"". Commercial performance. Sugar Mountain debuted and peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart for the chart dated 2 July 2018, before falling 70 positions the following week. Awards and nominations. At the 32nd Annual ARIA Music Awards, the album was nominated for two awards; Best Pop Release and Breakthrough Artist. Rankin, Xavier Dunn and John Castle were additionally nominated for Engineer of the Year for their production on the album."

Built between 1946 and 1955 by the Ministry of Labour, it is considered the most important architectural work built in the 20th century in the Asturias region and, with its 270,000 m, the largest building in Spain, even larger than the Monastery of El Escorial. The building was originally built to educate orphans whose parents had died as a result of working in the mining industry. It is currently a multi-use facility. Abandoned in the 1980s, the whole building was restored between 2001 and 2007. On 19 May 2016, the Universidad Laboral was listed as a Bien de Interés Cultural heritage site. On 12 February 2020, the Gijón city council, with the votes of left-wing parties PSOE, Podemos and IU, declined to launch a campaign for promoting the Universidad Laboral as World Heritage Site by arguing it ""reflects Francoism "", since it was built during the dictatorship era, even though the idea of this building was born in the Second Republic.

Urban Blitz is an English rock musician, best known for his ""eerie and atmospheric"" (Ira Robbins) electric violin, baritone violectra and lead guitar work with the 1970s London protopunk art rock band Doctors of Madness. However, Blitz had considerable earlier musical experience, graduating from a classical background to hone his skills on the London late 1960s, and early 1970s club and pub rock scene. He travelled to Italy in early 1973, to play with the Neapolitan Italian / Celtic chanteuse, Jenny Sorrenti. He lived and rehearsed with Sorrenti's band, 'Saint Just', in the House on the Lake on Lake Bracciano, that led to the album of the same name, but before the recording, Blitz left Italy to join the Doctors of Madness in June 1974. With Doctors of Madness, Blitz further developed his unique counterpoint electric violin style, incorporating a garage rock edge to complement the Doctor's nihilistic, manic, approach to rock music; using fuzz box, wah-wah pedal, phasing, echoplex and reverberation to appropriate effect. He cited avant garde violinists Jean-Luc Ponty, Don ""Sugarcane"" Harris and John Cale of the Velvet Underground as his main influences; having largely rejected his early classical training. Blitz was also an adventurous violin designer and maker, and in the early 1970s produced the first ‘skeleton’ electric violin design that is widely copied and adapted in mass-produced electric violins today. Blitz's multifaceted lead guitar work also made a significant impact throughout the Doctors' music. In the mid 1970s, Blitz did occasional freelance studio work, playing the electric violin solo on ""Watch Out Carolina"", produced by David Essex, for The Real Thing, and he also showed some flair as a producer himself, working with York punk rock band The Jermz on their singles ""Powercut"" and Me and My Baby."

This book consists of two main plot threads, which only come together towards the end of the book. A variety of Ringworld hominid species, led by the Machine woman Valavirgillin (from The Ringworld Engineers), join together to kill a large nest of vampires (the shadow nest) which has been feeding on all of them. With the help of two Ghouls, who know that the nest is located under an abandoned floating factory, they manage to cast out the vampires. The Ghouls find one of the Hindmost 's spying devices in the factory and transport it all the way to the rim, to ask for help against the Protectors who rule the rim. Meanwhile, Louis Wu decides to die of old age instead of asking the Hindmost for rejuvenation, as self-punishment for his helping the Hindmost to restabilize the Ringworld at the end of The Ringworld Engineers, killing (as he thinks) a trillion hominids to save the rest. After ten years of wandering around the Ringworld and aging, the Hindmost convinces him that he killed far fewer people than expected. Since there are signs of several Protectors on the Ringworld, Louis returns to the Hindmost to be restored to health in exchange for service, only for the pair of them (along with a Kzin named Acolyte, son of Chmeee) to be enslaved by a vampire Protector (""Bram"").

74029648,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellegrini_Chapel_(San_Bernardino),Pellegrini Chapel (San Bernardino),"Abstract. The Pellegrini Chapel (Italian: Cappella Pellegrini), initially named ""Guaresco,"" is a religious building commissioned by Countess Margherita Pellegrini to the famous architect Michele Sanmicheli and built between 1528 and 1559. It occupies a prominent place in Renaissance architecture. It is located within the Franciscan complex of San Bernardino in Verona, which consists of a Gothic-style church and a series of valuable cloisters and became a coveted place for Verona's noble families to build their aristocratic chapels between the 15th and 16th centuries. History. Description. The presence of Michele Sanmicheli 's preliminary designs in the Uffizi Gallery has made it possible to learn about the evolutionary stages of the work: the Veronese architect, in fact, at first planned to build a chapel with a Greek-cross plan larger than the one actually realized; externally, then, the surface was to be more articulated and decorated thanks to the presence of tall pilasters, of Corinthian order placed on pedestals, and the dome, visible even from outside. A monumental project, taking inspiration from the Pantheon in Rome and Raphael 's Chigi Chapel in the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo. The final design underwent numerous changes, yet the work retained a solemn appearance, especially inside. The chapel is accessible exclusively from the church hall through a monumental entrance portal, from which one is first ushered into a square vestibule, covered by a coffered barrel vault, and then into the building proper, through a second portal. The monumental vestibule is a rather original solution and a result of the need to prevent the structure from interfering with the Avanzi and Medici chapels already present in San Bernardino. The building has a circular plan with a diameter of 12 meters and a height of 20.5 meters, divided into two orders by a balcony with parapet and covered by a coffered dome crowned by a lantern; the diameter of the first order is smaller than that of the upper one, a feature that distinguishes this chapel from others, where, moreover, the dome often stands directly on the first order. While the exterior is devoid of decoration and the dome is adorned by a lantern, a style that is well suited to the sobriety of the Franciscan spirit, the interior, on the other hand, is distinguished by a compact and rigorous articulation of space and by the presence of an elegant decorative apparatus, which clearly echoes that of Porta Borsari, such as the alternation of vertical and twisted fluting, the rhythm of projections and recesses, and the giant tabernacles. The first level, of Corinthian order, has four large aediculae surmounted by round arches, three of which are occupied by altars while one houses the wide entrance door; each aedicula is then set in a frame formed by a giant tabernacle composed of fluted half-columns above which the entablature with triangular pediment is set. The keystones of the arches bear the heraldic symbols of the Pellegrini family, a pilgrim, and of the Raimondi family, a crowned eagle, while on either side are carved female figures, angelic and allegorical representations of victory and Christian virtues. Interspersed with the tabernacles are empty niches that would have housed statues, decorated on the sides with candelabras carved in the lesenes, by shells in the basins and garlands at the base of the top entablature. The first order is surmounted by a balcony with parapet, at the height of which begins the second, larger-diameter level, also of Corinthian order, which serves as the drum on which the dome is set; it is distinguished by the presence of four aediculae and four large tripartite windows with coupled columns that are located at the tabernacles of the lower level. A peculiarity, compared to the first order, is that only the columns and entablature are made of stone, while the rest is in lime plaster and marble dust, although the resulting surface has been bush-hammered and scraped as if it had been stone. The coffered dome with rosettes on a blue background, surmounted by a lantern, covers the chapel; the effect given by the color makes the interior space look majestic while the plasticity of the decorations is enhanced by the light that penetrates from the lantern and the stained-glass windows of the drum, giving the monument as a whole a striking elegance. The dome with drum, present here for the first time, became a Sanmichelian stylistic feature, as can be seen in the domes of the church of Madonna di Campagna, San Giorgio in Braida and the temple of Lazzaretto. The chapel abounds with sculptural decorations whose elegance of execution finds few other examples in 16th-century architecture, and although the final result of the work turns out to be different from the initial plan drawn up by Sanmicheli, it recalls the style of the Veronese architect in many respects. The plan itself turns out to be very similar to that of the Petrucci chapel, built between 1516 and 1523 at the church of San Domenico in Orvieto. On the chapel's high altar, in front of the entrance, there is a painting by Bernardino India from 1579 depicting the Madonna and Child with St. Anne; in the crescent a painting by Pasquale Ottini depicts the Eternal Father, while on either side of India's altarpiece there are two other paintings by Ottini depicting St. Joseph and St. Joachim. Ottini's paintings were probably made between 1619 and 1623. The building was intended to house other paintings, as evidenced by blank panels in the walls, which, however, were never made."
20348279,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podaxis,Podaxis,"Abstract. Podaxis is a genus of secotioid fungi in the family Agaricaceae. Species, which have the appearance of a ""stalked-puffball"", have a worldwide distribution, and tend to be found growing solitary or scattered on sandy soils, especially in arid regions. Although close to 50 species have been described, it has been argued that many of them may represent extremes in the natural range of variations found in Podaxis pistillaris. Description. Fruiting bodies have the appearance of an unopened Coprinus comatus, with a stipe and a loose, brown to blackish powdery gleba at maturity. Basidiospores are obovate, thick-walled with a large apical pore, and typically 10-17 x 9-12 µm in size. Clamp connections are present. Podaxis is a common inhabitant of soil and termite mounds throughout the drier regions of the tropics and subtropics of the world. P. pistillaris is a ground-inhabiting species, but most Podaxis species in the rest of the world are associated with termite mounds. This includes the Australian species P. beringamensis. Taxonomy. The genus was originally named Podaxis and circumscribed by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1809, while Elias Magnus Fries later (1829) called the taxon Podaxon. Although a number of articles have used the latter name, Podaxis is the preferred name as it has nomenclatorial priority due to its earlier publication. Early suggestions that Podaxis was related to the genus Coprinus were later confirmed using phylogenetic analysis based on sequence data of rDNA genes. This research showed that Podaxis is in a clade with the species Montagnea arenaria and Agaricus pocillator, and the genus Leucocoprinus. For this reason, Podaxis was transferred to the family Agaricaceae (order Agaricales) from the now obsolete family name Podaxaceae (order Podaxales). A section of Podaxis, named Parvispora, was circumscribed to accommodate three species (P. argentinus, P. longii and P. microsporus) with small spores. Species. As of January 2016, Index Fungorum accepts 28 species in Podaxis: Uses. The dark purple spores of Podaxis species are used by Australian aborigines as a face paint. Podaxis aegyptiacus is used as a common traditional medicine in the Bamako region of Mali for wound-healing, and water extracts from the mushroom have been shown to have carbohydrates with beneficial effects on the immune system in vitro."
75324787,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_integrated_flight_test_2,SpaceX Starship integrated flight test 2,"Abstract. SpaceX Starship Integrated Flight Test 2 (IFT-2) was the second integrated flight test of SpaceX Starship launch vehicle. SpaceX performed the flight test on November 18, 2023. The mission's primary objectives were for the vehicle to hot stage —a new addition to Starship's flight profile—followed by the second stage attaining a near-orbital trajectory with a controlled reentry over the Pacific Ocean, while the booster does a boostback burn with a propulsive splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The vehicle successfully lifted off under the power of all 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy Booster and made it through stage separation. The booster was planned to land on the Gulf of Mexico, but instead exploded during its boostback burn. The Starship second stage continued to accelerate for over 8 minutes, reaching an altitude of 149 km (93 mi). Towards the end of the second stage burn the Ship vented excess liquid oxygen, resulting in a fire and loss of the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a statement confirming that an anomaly had occurred and that there were no reports of public property damage or injuries. The FCC considered the launch as a failure and used this as a rationale for rejecting SpaceX Starlink as eligible for large US rural broadband internet subsidies. Shortly after the launch, SpaceX made a statement on their website saying that ""success comes from what we learn"" from a ""test like this"". Background. After the first test flight in April 2023, which ended in the destruction of the entire Starship vehicle, significant work was done on the launch mount to repair the damage it sustained during the test and to prevent future issues. Meanwhile, following Starship's first flight failure, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) required SpaceX to conduct an investigation on the mishap, grounding Starship pending the outcome of their investigation. The FAA closed the investigation on September 8, 2023. The FWS fully concluded its environmental review on November 14, and the FAA gave its full approval for launch shortly after. Flight profile. The spacecraft flight plan was to lift off from SpaceX's Starbase facility along the south Texas coast, then conduct a partial orbit around Earth. The Super Heavy had a planned boostback burn followed by a soft water landing in the Gulf of Mexico, similarly to a Falcon 9 performing a return to launch site landing (RTLS). The Starship spacecraft was then to re-enter the atmosphere and perform a water landing in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii, without performing a landing burn. Launch analysis. On November 11, 2023, SpaceX announced that they were targeting a launch date of November 17, pending regulatory approval. On November 14, the FWS concluded its environmental review, and the FAA gave its approval for launch. On November 16, the flight was delayed one day, due to a grid fin actuator needing to be replaced on B9. The first launch attempt of the second integrated flight test occurred on November 18 at 13:02 UTC (7:02 a.m. CST). Booster 9 and Ship 25 lifted off the pad. The rocket encountered maximum aerodynamic stress (Max q) with no anomalies reported. Starship executed a successful separation, powering down all but three of Super Heavy’s Raptor engines and successfully igniting the six second stage Raptor engines before separating the vehicles. Following stage separation, Super Heavy initiated its flip maneuver, and then its boostback burn: the flight computers sent commands to 13 of the vehicle’s 33 Raptor engines to propel the rocket toward its intended landing location. During this burn, several engines began shutting down before one engine failed, leading to the explosion of the booster. The Super Heavy vehicle breakup occurred over three and a half minutes into the flight at an altitude of ~90 km over the Gulf of Mexico.All Starship's six second stage Raptor engines powered the vehicle to an altitude of 148 km, above common boundaries of space, and a velocity of ~24,000 km/h, becoming the first Starship to reach outer space and nearly completing its full-duration burn. Near the end of Starship's second stage burn, after over eight minutes of flight and prior to engine cutoff, telemetry was lost. SpaceX said that a safe command destroyed the second stage prior to achieving its planned orbit or attempting re-entry. According to astronomer Jonathan McDowell, at his predicted re-entry point, NOAA weather radar picked up a debris cloud a few hundred miles north of the Virgin Islands. In January 2024, SpaceX said that because Starship carried no payload, they planned to vent excess liquid oxygen from the second stage near the end of the burn. The venting of that oxygen led to a fire and explosion. Elon Musk echoed the assessment, writing: ""Flight 2 actually almost made it to orbit... If it had a payload, it would have made it to orbit because the reason that it actually didn’t quite make it to orbit was we vented the liquid oxygen."" Upon the FAA's closure of the investigation on February 26, SpaceX elaborated on the cause of the accident thusly: At vehicle separation, Starship’s upper stage lit all six Raptor engines and flew a normal ascent until approximately seven minutes into the flight, when a planned vent of excess liquid oxygen propellant began. Additional propellant had been loaded on the spacecraft as a payload simulant and needed to be disposed of prior to reentry to meet required propellant mass targets at splashdown. A leak in the aft section of the spacecraft that developed when the liquid oxygen vent was initiated resulted in a combustion event and subsequent fires that led to a loss of communication between the spacecraft’s flight computers. This resulted in a commanded shutdown of all six engines prior to completion of the ascent burn, followed by the Autonomous Flight Safety System detecting a mission rule violation and performing flight termination, leading to vehicle breakup at an altitude of ~150 km and a velocity of ~24,000 km/h, becoming the first Starship to reach outer space. On the booster's fate, SpaceX stated that the most likely root cause was filter blockages where liquid oxygen is supplied to the engines, leading to a loss of inlet pressure in the engines' oxidizer turbopumps that eventually resulted in one engine failing in such a manner that it resulted in the loss of the vehicle. This led SpaceX to implement hardware changes inside the booster oxidizer tanks related to propellant filtration and reliability. Aftermath. SpaceX and Cameron County reopened the road to the launch site a few hours after the launch. This was noted by CNN as a faster reopening than during the first flight attempt, when it remained closed for two days. NASA administrator Bill Nelson congratulated the teams involved in the test flight, and retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield called it a ""very successful 2nd test flight"" in a post on X. SpaceX considered the mission a success. Elon Musk later stated that the water deluge would not require any refurbishment for IFT-3. According to SpaceX, the water-cooled flame deflector and other pad upgrades performed as expected, requiring minimal post-launch work to be ready for upcoming vehicle tests and the next integrated flight test. In December 2023 the Federal Communications Commission issued final denial of an $885 million Starlink subsidy because all attempted Starship launches ""have failed"". At the time of the Bureau's decision, Starship had not yet been launched. Indeed, even as of today, Starship has not yet had a successful launch; all of its attempted launches have failed. Based on Starlink’s previous assertions about its plans to launch its second-generation satellites via Starship, and the information that was available at the time, the Bureau necessarily considered Starlink’s continuing inability to successfully launch the Starship rocket when making predictive judgment about its ability to meet its RDOF obligations. 17 significant changes were made to the Starship vehicle, including upgrading the ship to an electric thrust-vector control system and delaying the ship LOX dump to after SECO. SpaceX said the water-cooled flame deflector and other pad upgrades made after Starship’s first flight test had performed as expected, requiring ""minimal post-launch work to be ready for vehicle tests and the next integrated flight test"". Following the flight test, SpaceX said it had led the investigation efforts with oversight from the FAA and participation from NASA, and the National Transportation Safety Board."

The flowers are arranged singly or in cymes with minute bracts. The petals are usually pink or white, sometimes blue or yellowish-green. Taxonomy. The genus was first described in 1839 by John Lindley in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. Most of the species now placed in the genus were first described in the genus Boronia, with which Cyanothamnus was synonymized. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2020 showed that as then circumscribed Boronia was polyphyletic, and Lindley's genus was revived. A 2021 classification of the family Rutaceae places Cyanothamnus in the subfamily Zanthoxyloideae."

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II* listed building. History. There are records of a chaplain at or possibly from Chadkirk in 1347; however, the fact that the name incorporates the word ""kirk"", deriving from the Scandinavian word for a church or chapel, points to even earlier worship here, at a time when Scandinavian influence on the local dialects of English was strong enough for ""kirk"" to be a usual word for a house of worship. The earliest part of the present structure is the half-timbered east end dating back, very probably, to the 16th century, the time of the Tudor kings and queens and of the Reformation, the break between the English Church and the Church of Rome. In time, however, the chapel fell into disuse and decay. It passed through a succession of owners and is even reputed to have been used as a stable. Subsequently, it was used by Nonconformists but they were ejected during the reign of Queen Anne and erected a new chapel at Hatherlow, at the top of the hill overlooking Chadkirk. The chapel once again fell into neglect and was ""in a ruinous condition"" until in 1747 it was taken over once more by the Church of England and was substantially rebuilt in stone. Further repairs were carried out at Chadkirk in 1761 and 1860. In 1876 there was a restoration when much of the furniture was removed. The chapel was declared redundant in 1971, deconsecrated and then purchased by Bredbury and Romiley Urban District Council. In 1974 local government reorganisation abolished urban districts and the area was transferred to the newly created Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. The chapel was restored in 1995 and is used as a wedding venue by Stockport Council and for community events, meetings and activities managed by the non-profit community organisation the Friends of Chadkirk. The Friends group helps to maintain and run the chapel and surrounding estate. Architecture. The present building dates from the 16th century, although the south walls were rebuilt in 1747.

Between 1790 and 1796, it was planned to use the land in the Molkenmarkt 1 area for the construction of the new city bailiwick. Projects were designed by members of the Oberhofbauamt and construction began in 1791 under the direction of Paul Ludwig Simon and Friedrich Gilly. Solomo Sachs had, not officially requested, designed two facades for this. These were the facades of the portal and the front on the Spree side, which the authority accepted very favourably, and for which he received his first public recognition. Since 1786 the Academy of Arts and Mechanical Science published the catalogue for the annual Academy exhibition. In the following years the biennial rhythm was introduced. The aim was to distinguish the Berlin public from the other academies in Kassel and Dresden. In the years 1786 to 1816, mainly architectural models and designs based on antique models took up space. A large proportion of the entries were submitted by academy students and younger Conducteuren. In 1794, Johann Carl Gottlieb Schlaetzer, Salomo Sachs, August Ferdinand Mandel (1771–1846), Johann Georg Moser and Paul Ludwig Simon were able to contribute their designs for churches, prisons, a playhouse, hunting lodge, country houses and town houses, summer houses and mortuaries to the exhibition and catalogue. In 1798 Sachs designed a mortuary for the Society of Friends (Gesellschaft der Freunde), but for financial reasons it was never executed. From 1799 to 1806 he taught as a drawing teacher for architecture and a teacher for machine drawings at the Bauakademie, which was newly founded by King Frederick William III. on 6 July 1799. Family and siblings. On 21 September 1802 he married Henriette Isser from Hamburg in Berlin. The marriage produced a son. His son Albert Sachs (* 29 August 1803 in Berlin, † 11 November 1835 ibid.) became a doctor. His uncle was Jüdel Sachs (born 10 April 1752 in Berlin; died 17 May 1819 ibid.), who was a gardener by profession and made a name for himself as a pioneer of career changes. (To provide new career prospects for Jews who were no longer allowed to work in the professions they had previously practised or who had little or no chance of advancement.) Salomo Sachs had the following siblings Jewish couples, but also Veile and Alexander Benda as well as Süßsche and Jacob Joel, had to file applications for marriage licenses, in some cases also for marriage certificates and, after marriage, for the children's rights of residence. New Guardhouse (Neue Wache) and the outbreak of war. In 1806, shortly before the outbreak of the French war, the Collegium of the Bauakademie was commissioned by the highest authority to draw up and submit plans for the reconstruction of the Opera Bridge with a guardhouse nearby and the construction of a massive dog bridge (castle bridge). Here, the older and higher-ranking officials of the Collegium were in demand, for example Johann Heinrich Gentz. As a young civil servant, Solomo Sachs was so fascinated by this task that he worked out his own drawings, ideas and drafts in complete silence. He submitted them to his teacher, the privy councillor Becherer, who submitted the drawings for examination. Against all the specialists' magnificent drawings, his designs for the Palace Bridge and the New Guardhouse won the prize. The outbreak of war delayed the plans. The Coalition Wars and the War of Liberation 1813–1815 and the search for new intentions. After the lost war, the financing of the Bauakademie and the Oberhofbauamt fell victim to the state austerity measures in favour of contributions to France and Sachs lost his job. He received waiting pay from the government from 1808 to 1816. Only after the end of the war was the plan resumed by Friedrich Schinkel, but now it was implemented with its adaptations. It was not until 1842 that Sachs noted in his autobiography that the new guardhous in particular resembled his basic designs, with the exception of Schinkel's masterly decoration of the building. ""Here I cannot fail to point out how the basic features of the building complex up to the new guardhouse, as it stands there now, correspond to mine. At first I had put this building on aligned, not with the armoury but with the university. The peculiarity of my construction was that the façade was actually formed by the rear front (high wall), in that the roof was to have its waste only towards the rear. In addition, two short side wings, connected by a Blinding-Masonry at the back and enclosing a small courtyard, were placed in such a way that the whole was a closed square. Finally, the façade was decorated with 6 Doric columns and two pavilions on each side. I hope that nobody will take offence at the comparison I am making here between Schinkel's design and my earlier project of one and the same building, because I am not talking about Schinkel's elaborate decoration of the building, but only about the adaptation of the execution and the construction"" Struggling for reinstatement into the Prussian civil service. On the basis of a specially-prepared expert opinion of 23 September 1815, for the Jewish community of Berlin, following damage caused by moisture to the dome of the Old Synagogue, Sachs had produced architectural drawings. On 7 April 1816, Sachs asked the king for his reinstatement. This request was rejected on the basis of Prussian Jewish Edict §9 of 1812. However, his second petition, dated 24 April 1816, led to success through the king, who allowed the exception to the rule, and through the announcement of the supreme cabinet order of 29 April 1816, by Cabinet Counsel Albrecht. At this time, Sachs lived at 49 Markgrafenstrasse and was a neighbor of Abraham Mendelssohn Bartholdy. His transfer to Marienwerder in West Prussia. From 1816 to 1820 he worked as Country master builder for the Royal Government Marienwerder in West Prussia. From the laying of the foundation stone on 3 May 1818 until its ceremonial consecration on 3 August 1823, a Protestant church was built in Mewe according to plans by Schinkel, under the construction supervision of Sachs. In other church buildings in Stuhm and Marienwerder he was discriminated against by Protestant clergy anti-Semitic, which is why he built here as a Jew. He implemented Schinkel's designs despite all adversities. There were great difficulties in doing so, because the construction drawings of Schinkel were partly not understood or misinterpreted by Sachs' superior, the government and building official Balkow (1816–1825 building official in Marienwerder). In 1819, Salomo Sachs opened a Baugewerkschule in Marienwerder, which existed for 15 years until 1834. He took over the management and offered free lessons. His transfer back to Potsdam. From 1820 to 1830 he was again, under his qualification, employed as Country master builder in the fourth building district at the Royal Government in Potsdam and was an employee of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. From 8 December 1820 Sachs was appointed to the examination commission for building craftsmen, and his area of responsibility here was the district of Spandau. At this time he lived at Spandauerstraße 49 in the center of Berlin. On 3 December 1824 a so-called art road from Prenzlauer Tor to Heinersdorf was approved, it is today's Prenzlauer Allee. Sachs had done all the preliminary work here, including surveying, design, situation plan and cost planning. He brought together the most distinguished residents, who enabled him to do the necessary work financially. This group formed a public limited company, which, with the help of the government, put the project into practice. In 1825 Sachs began planning the new construction of the Fasanenmeisterhaus in the Tiergarten in its improved loam construction. The commission was given by the royal chief hunter Friedrich Detlev Graf von Moltke. (1750–1825). According to an expert opinion, issued by Friedrich Schinkel and Johann Carl Ludwig Schmid, on his rammed earth pisé buildings, which was devastating for Sachs, he was unable to complete his work. Schinkel was commissioned by the Oberbaudeputat to execute the house in classical brick construction. The animosity of the members of the Oberbaudeputation against Salomo Sachs increased further. After Sachs was crushed by the Oberbaudepartement with his plans for the new home of the pheasant hunter, he was commissioned by Wilhelm zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein to hand over his drawings and cost accounting, for comparison with Schinkel's designs. After the handover, his work disappeared forever, despite demands for restitution, and Sachs was not paid for his expenses until 17 years later. Despite these setbacks and insinuations, he continued to work on his reputation. In 1829 he was commissioned by the sons of Otto von Voß to Birkholz (Bernau near Berlin) to design and rebuild a new church tower. At the same time Carl Justus Heckmann for the roofing and Carl August Mencke for the gilding of the spire were also appointed to the building work. From 1829 to 1830, Sachs became increasingly disliked by the royal government and his superiors. He had been commissioned by the military, who were convinced of his cost-saving clay construction method, to build a cavalry horse stable in Charlottenburg. At the request of the military leadership, the construction was to take place very quickly and under his sole leadership without the participation of the royal government. This caused further tensions with his superiors, as the design in brick was already available. The involuntary retirement. With his involuntary retirement in 1830, Salomo Sachs' career in the Prussian civil service came to an end. In June, he once again expressed his unbroken enthusiasm for his work with a design for a monument to Friedrich II. He was praised for this by his superiors.From then on, he devoted himself to his literary work, the restoration of his reputation and the validity of his improved pisé building (through expert opinions) The emancipation of the Jews always remained an important concern. An article in the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums of 26 June 1847 once again demonstrates the efforts of Solomon Sachs, even at the high age of 75, that Jewish emancipation continued to be a current topic for him. A controversial statement by the Landtag commissioner Minister Ernst von Bodelschwingh the Elder, during the discussion of the Prussian Jewish Law of 1847 at a city council meeting, led to a retrospective encounter with Sachs. Some people had wrongly assumed that here in Berlin a Jewish building inspector had once existed. He drove to the hotel of the Ministry of the Interior and waited for the minister there to hand over his biography with picture and signature as a souvenir.Bodelschwingh thanked him and asked him whether he had remained true to the Jewish faith and received a pension from the state. However, but so small that I cannot really blame Your Honourable Excellency if you doubted my existence. On 25 July 1848, the constituent Prussian National Assembly met at its 32nd session in the rooms of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. In the commission report on the motion of the members of parliament Count Eduard von Reichenbach, Dr. Stein and Dr. Elsner to change the meeting room of 26 May, Baurat Eduard Knoblauch had been commissioned to find or rebuild a suitable larger plenary hall with various building surveys. A provisional construction of a new house for the Prussian Chambers had also been suggested to the commission by the untiringly Sachs. His plan for the house referred to the part of the chestnut grove at Am Kupfergraben that adjoins Dorotheenstraße. ""This morning, in the 83rd year, of the Köngl. building inspector Sachs gently and painlessly fell asleep.. The funeral will take place from the house of death Grenadierstraße 18th (Scheunenviertel) Wednesday the 16th, Vormitt. 9 o'clock.

4731974,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Naturalist,Death of a Naturalist,"Abstract. Death of a Naturalist (1966) is a collection of poems written by Seamus Heaney, who received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature. The collection was Heaney's first major published volume, and includes ideas that he had presented at meetings of The Belfast Group. Death of a Naturalist won the Cholmondeley Award, the Gregory Award, the Somerset Maugham Award, and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize. The work consists of 34 short poems and is largely concerned with childhood experiences and the formulation of adult identities, family relationships, and rural life. The collection begins with one of Heaney's best-known poems, ""Digging"", and includes the acclaimed ""Death of a Naturalist"" and ""Mid-Term Break"". In 2022, Death of a Naturalist was included on the ""Big Jubilee Read "" list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Poems. From Mid-term Break Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple, He lay in the four foot box as in his cot. No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear. A four foot box, a foot for every year. from ""Mid-term break"", Death of a Naturalist (1966) ""Death of a Naturalist"", the collection's second poem, details the exploits of a young boy collecting frogspawn from a flax-dam. The narrator remembers everything he saw and felt at those times. He then remembers his teacher telling him all about frogs in a section that speaks volumes about childhood innocence. Finally, we hear about a trip to the flax-dam that went wrong. He feels threatened by the frogs and flees. His interest in nature has gone – this is the death of a ""naturalist"" suggested in the poem's title. The poem makes extensive use of onomatopoeia and a simile that compares the behaviour of the amphibians to warfare (""Some sat poised like mud grenades"") amongst other techniques. ""Mid-Term Break"" is a reflection on the death of Heaney's younger brother, Christopher, while Heaney was at school. He describes his parents' different ways of displaying grief, visitors paying their respects, and his encounter of his brother's corpse in its coffin the next morning. The poem focuses on concrete particulars of Heaney's experience and ""captures a boy's unfolding consciousness of death."" The final line (""A four foot box, a foot for every year."") emphasizes death's finality. ""Digging"" is one of Heaney's most-read poems. It addresses themes of time and history and the cyclical nature of the two through the narrators characterization of his grandfather digging in the bog on their family farm. He admires his grandfather's skill and relationship to the spade, but states that he will dig with his pen instead. This is significant as it demonstrates Heaney's ownership of his occupation as a poet and names his pen as his primary and most powerful tool. While excavating the mental bog of his mind by writing, Heaney believes he can gain a better understanding of the history living in the land around him, and a better understanding of himself. From Digging Between my finger and my thumb The squat pen rests. I'll dig with it. from ""Digging"", Death of a Naturalist (1966) ""Personal Helicon"" is the final poem in Heaney's first collection. Helicon refers to the mountain in Greek mythology which is dedicated to the Greek God Apollo, who is the God of poetry. On the mountain live nine muses, each of whom represent a poetic inspiration. In Heaney's Helicon is a well which indicates that his inspiration comes from within the earth rather than above it. This theme resonates across his work in the poem ""Digging"" or in the later Bog Poems. He also states that he rhymes ""to see myself"", echoing the common theme found in the poem ""Digging"" that he uses poetry to understand the depths of the well and his reflection within it. Throughout the poem, Heaney walks the reader through each stage of his life up until the point he wrote Personal Helicon. He expresses to the reader how he loses sight of the outside inspirations he sought after as a child, and instead looks to himself. This can be seen when he states, ""To stare, big-eyed Narcissus into some spring is beneath all adult dignity"". In this quote he parallels himself to Narcissus, a hunter in Greek Mythology who is cursed to fall in love with his own reflection by the goddess Nemesis after he shuns Echo, an Oread nymph. The reader can see that for a short time after his college experience, Heaney relies on only himself for inspiration. Eventually he realizes his mistake, and unlike Narcissus, is able to bring himself back to reality. Reception. Death of a Naturalist was received with mostly positive reviews and helped Heaney gain recognition on an international scale. Several of the poems had been published previously in pamphlets like ""Eleven Poems"" (1965) and gained attention with reviews in the Belfast Telegraph, Death of a Naturalist received over 30 noteworthy reviews in Ireland, England and the United States. Fellow poets Michael Longley and Brendan Kennelly also praised Heaney's work. Critics generally remarked on Heaney's skilful use of metaphor and language as well as his attention to detail and rural imagery. Some reviewers found the volume a bit superfluous. John Unterecker of The New York Times Book Review stated that he found some poems possessed ""a wit that is sometimes heavy-handed"". Contents."
45452377,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Oakland_Elementary_School_shooting,1988 Oakland Elementary School shooting,"Abstract. The Oakland Elementary School shooting was a school shooting in 1988 in Greenwood, South Carolina, United States, in which 19-year-old James William Wilson Jr. shot and killed two students and wounded seven other students, a teacher, and a gym coach at Oakland Elementary School. He shot people in the cafeteria and in a classroom. Wilson had a history of mental illness. Shooting. On the morning of September 26, 1988, Wilson drove to his maternal grandmother's house and stole her.22 caliber, nine-shot revolver. He then drove to an Abbeville discount store and purchased some.22 hollow-point long rifle ammunition. Wilson discarded the bullets already loaded in the gun and reloaded the weapon with the more destructive hollow-point bullets. He next proceeded to the Oakland Elementary School in Greenwood, where he parked his 1974 Maverick. He entered the school, finding his way to the cafeteria, where he stood quietly for a moment. It was right at lunch time for many of the children. Next, Wilson pulled out the pistol and began shooting, picking his victims, both children and adults, at random. Witnesses observed a look of hatred and rage masking Wilson's face. He wounded three students and a first-grade teacher. Survivors were evacuated from the cafeteria by teachers and staff, and towards a wooded area; others hid in the cafeteria's freezer before moving toward the woods. Some sought shelter in a neighboring home. He left the cafeteria and entered a girls’ restroom to reload. He was confronted by physical education teacher Kat Finkbeiner, who accosted him and tried to stop him in the restroom; he shot her twice, wounding her. He then entered a third-grade classroom. Finkbeiner entered the room and tried to force him to surrender but he kept firing. He shot at the third-grade teacher, missing and hitting the blackboard. Wilson turned toward the students and opened fire, killing Shequila Bradley, who died at the scene, and Tequila Thomas, who died three days later, both eight years old, and wounding five students. Once the gun was empty, he dropped the gun and followed students as they evacuated the building. When the police arrived, principal Eleanor Rice had made contact with Wilson who presented several forms of identification. Eleanor Rice searched him for weapons and had physical education teacher Phillip Browning stand with Wilson while Eleanor Rice left to find the police. Police were taken to his location where they arrested him. Perpetrator. James William Wilson Jr. (born April 13, 1969) was 19 years old, unemployed, and living a rather isolated life with his paternal grandmother. He had frequently been a patient at psychiatric hospitals, starting at the age of 14. He was treated with the benzodiazepine drug Xanax to address his anxiety and depression and got relief from his symptoms with this medication. His family's insurance eventually ran out and he was no longer able to be treated as an in-patient. Wilson would take the prescription medication in about 10 days when it was meant to last several months. Wilson voluntarily entered the psychiatric unit of Self Memorial Hospital on several occasions. The first was about four years before the shooting, following an incident in which his grandmother and her husband called police after Wilson had locked them in a back bedroom and left the house in a violent frenzy. Because Wilson was a juvenile and no family court petition was signed, he was not arrested or jailed. He was referred to a psychiatrist at Self Memorial Hospital. There were other incidents in the coming years, but police were not called. Family members said they were not surprised at it happening and that they were all upset over the shooting, but were not shocked.Wilson was obsessed with the film Psycho and had watched it 500 times. He was also fascinated by mass murderers and how they carried out their crimes. Shortly before the shooting, Wilson had used his library card to check out crime books. Among the four books he checked out was an account of a mass murderer who buried bodies in his back yard and basement. The morning of the shooting, Wilson talked of the book to his grandmother and joked about a recent murder in Greenwood in which a friend of Wilson’s shot his sister. Although the friend committed the murder with a gun, Wilson fabricated the story, saying that the murder was committed with an axe to make it seem more violent. Wilson often joked about violence and would make comments to family members, saying, “Do you think they get a thrill out of (whatever the violent scenario was)?” and then follow the statement with laughter. Aftermath. After the shooting the teachers employed methods to help the students such as reducing the noise of the chairs with felt on their feet, and placing a large cupboard by the door to have something to barricade the entrance."

7167413,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Tree_Mall,Liberty Tree Mall,"Abstract. The Liberty Tree Mall is a shopping mall in Danvers, Massachusetts, U.S., managed by the Simon Property Group. It is anchored by Kohl's, Total Wine & More, AMC Theatres, Marshalls, Old Navy, Sky Zone, and Best Buy, along with Aldi Tenants: Mainly Tubs, Addario's Services, & Metro By T Mobile Simon Property Group owns one-third of the common area of the mall; the Michaels Strip Mall, and the entire interior space between Kohl's and Best Buy. The right-hand area of the property from Best Buy to Staples is owned by Target. The property from Kohl's to Dick's Sporting Goods is owned by New England Development, the mall's original developer. History. Construction began in 1969, and the mall opened with a dedication ceremony on February 21, 1972. The mall was renovated and expanded first in 1980 and again in 1993. The mall is located less than a mile away from the Northshore Mall in Peabody, although both malls are primarily owned and managed by Simon Property Group. Since the 1980s, the Liberty Tree Mall has focused more on the discount end, whereas the Northshore Mall has focused on the mainstream/upscale end, thus enabling them to coexist semi-peacefully. Ann & Hope, one of the former anchor stores of the mall, opened in 1969 before the mall was completed. Lechmere was the mall's other anchor, which opened with the rest of the mall in 1972. The name Liberty Tree derives from the local version of Boston 's Liberty Tree, which originally stood in downtown Boston. During the early years of the mall, a large metal tree stood at the center court to commemorate the Liberty Tree. The sculpture was a featured exhibit in the New England Pavilion at the 1964–65 New York World's Fair and was designed by Albert Surman, who died in 2010. The sculpture was removed in 1992 to make room for renovations to the mall and was later scrapped in 1993. In 1980, a food court was added that included restaurants such as The Roast House and The Fairgrounds. A Marshalls was added during the 1980s, and has been in the mall since then. Marshalls is the only remaining original anchor store. Filene's Basement, which subleased a portion of the Lechmere space in 1983, moved to the Northshore Mall in the 1990s. Sports Authority and Old Navy were added after the 1993 food court-hallway expansion. Sports Authority closed in 2016, after the company filed for bankruptcy, and was replaced with SkyZone. Lechmere and Filene's Basement were anchor stores of the mall until 1997 when they were demolished and rebuilt into Target, Staples, Dollar Tree, and Best Buy in 1998–99. An f.y.e. replaced part of an area of smaller stores, converting them into a music store/video arcade (formerly Dream Machine), both of which have since closed. Another group of stores was converted to Bed Bath & Beyond. Ann & Hope closed their entire chain of stores in 2001, and this included the Liberty Tree Mall location. 211,300-square-foot (19,630 m) This location was later rebuilt into Kohl's. Stop & Shop and Pier 1 Imports were later built to the left of Kohl's. A Loews Theatres 20-screen multiplex was also added to the mall. In January 2008, Stop & Shop closed. The 91,000-square-foot (8,500 m) store was originally built in 2003. The former Stop & Shop space was converted for use by Nordstrom Rack and Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse, which opened in November 2008. In 2009, the former f.y.e. was replaced by a Steve & Barry's, which stayed open until the company filed for bankruptcy. In early 2013, PPE Casino Resorts applied to the state gambling commission for a slots parlor in the rear area of the mall, where Marshalls and the food court are located now. The announcement led to some debate, with some concerned about the character of the mall and others optimistic about jobs and revenue a slots parlor could generate for the community. On November 25, 2019, it was announced that A.C. Moore would close all 145 locations, including the location at Liberty Tree Mall. In May 2020, Pier 1 Imports announced that it would be closing all locations and going out of business due to bankruptcy. On August 10, 2022, it was reported that the Liberty Tree Mall was up for sale, and had been listed since July of that year. However it has since been removed from the market."
24219777,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scissor_Sisters_(convicted_killers),Scissor Sisters (convicted killers),"Abstract. Linda and Charlotte Mulhall (also called the Scissor Sisters by the media) are sisters from Dublin, Ireland, who killed and dismembered their mother's boyfriend, Farah Swaleh Noor, in March 2005. Noor was killed with a Stanley knife wielded by Charlotte and struck with a hammer by Linda following a confrontation with the sisters and their mother, Kathleen Mulhall. His head and penis were sliced off and the rest of his corpse dismembered and dumped in the Royal Canal in Dublin where a piece of leg, still wearing a sock, was spotted floating near Croke Park 10 days later. The subsequent manhunt and the trial in October 2006 attracted intense media attention as the details of the crime slowly emerged. The sisters and their mother were arrested but released until Linda confessed to involvement in the crime. Kathleen Mulhall left the country to live in England. When Charlotte and Linda were charged with murder in December 2005, their father, John Mulhall, hanged himself in Phoenix Park. Because of the method used in Noor's killing, the Mulhalls were dubbed the Scissor Sisters by the media. Justice Paul Carney, presiding over the trial, said during sentencing that it was ""the most grotesque killing that has occurred in my professional lifetime"". Charlotte Mulhall was given a mandatory life sentence and Linda Mulhall was given a 15-year sentence for manslaughter, with both being sent to Mountjoy Women's Prison in Dublin. Noor's head and penis were never recovered, although Linda later admitted they had put the head in rubbish bins around Phoenix Park. It was also thought that they carried the head by bus to Tallaght and buried it in a field, with Linda returning later to dig it up, carry it to another field using her son's schoolbag, smash it further with a hammer and bury it again. Linda attracted further media attention when she slit her wrists and was sectioned (involuntarily hospitalised). Charlotte also attracted media attention when a photograph of her holding a knife to a male prisoner's throat was published; that action resulted in an increased security presence in all Irish prisons and Charlotte was moved from Mountjoy to Limerick Prison. Kathleen Mulhall voluntarily returned to Ireland in February 2008 and faced several charges. She pleaded guilty to helping clean up the crime scene to conceal evidence and was sentenced to five years in prison in May 2009. The case resulted in several books being written and has been examined in at least one television series. It was said by the Irish Independent ' s legal affairs correspondent, Dearbhail McDonald, to have ""fuelled fears of ritual killings in Ireland"". Mulhall family background. The Mulhalls were from Kilclare Gardens, a working class area in Tallaght, south Dublin. Their parents John and Kathleen Mulhall raised a family of three boys and three girls. Kathleen was originally Kathleen Ward before she got married and was from the Travelling community. John Mulhall allegedly abused Kathleen. Their marriage broke down and Kathleen entered into a relationship with Farah Swaleh Noor in 2002. Noor also allegedly abused Kathleen Mulhall. Farah Swaleh Noor. Farah Swaleh Noor was 40 years old at the time of his death. He arrived in Ireland in December 1996, claiming to be a Somali called ""Sheilila Salim"" whose family had been killed in Mogadishu during the Somali Civil War. Subsequent investigations revealed that he was in fact a Kenyan and that his family was still alive. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform ordered that he be deported but he appealed and was granted Irish citizenship in March 1999 because he had become the father of an Irish-born child. He had four previous convictions for offences including intoxication, threatening and abusive behaviour and assault. In 1997, he raped a mentally disabled 16-year-old Chinese girl. She later gave birth to a son. Two other women had children by him and both described having been raped by him. Noor had faced eight charges of disorder and assault, one involving a sexual assault in which a knife was found at the scene by gardaí. He was convicted on three occasions but never served time in jail. Noor lived in a number of areas in Dublin, including Dún Laoghaire and Firhouse, as well as the inner city before moving in with Kathleen Mulhall. Gardaí described him as being particularly violent towards women. Events surrounding the killing. The killing took place at a flat Kathleen Mulhall was renting in a house on Richmond Cottages, Summerhill, on 20 March 2005. This was on the public holiday of Saint Patrick's weekend. Garda Síochána investigation. The killing only came to light ten days later when Noor's leg, with a sock on the end, was seen floating in the canal, a few hundred yards from Croke Park. Garda sub-aqua divers retrieved most of the rest of his body in seven parts. Gardaí traced his identity through media appeals. Noor was only identified when someone recognised a T-shirt on the recovered torso. That key witness, a Somali man who was the first to connect the missing Noor with the three Mulhall women, was paid a ""substantial"" reward by Crimestoppers. Noor's head and penis were never found. The sisters and their parents were arrested in August but denied any knowledge of the killing. A number of weeks later Linda contacted investigating officers admitting her involvement. Gardaí took a voluntary statement from her at her home in Tallaght in August 2005. Until this, Gardaí had been making limited progress in the case. When Gardaí searched the Mulhall flat in Summerhill, they found bloodstains that were later confirmed to match Noor's DNA. After Linda's confession, Kathleen Mulhall fled the country in September 2005 and gardaí were unable to locate her again until January 2008. She was living in England. Court cases.

Fairhope Plantation is a historic Carpenter Gothic plantation house and historic district, located one mile east of Uniontown, Alabama, US. The 2+ 1 ⁄ 2 -story wood-framed main house was built in the Gothic Revival style in the late 1850s. The plantation historic district includes six other contributing buildings, in addition to the main house. It was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on December 19, 1991, and subsequently to the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1992, due to its architectural and historical significance. History. Fairhope Plantation was built for Joseph Selden, a native of Virginia. He was born on June 4, 1831, and grew up at Westover Plantation in Charles City County, Virginia. Selden married Elizabeth Collier Minge, of Weynoke Plantation, Virginia, near Faunsdale, in 1854. Elizabeth was born on May 30, 1833. Her family was also originally from Charles City County. Joseph and Elizabeth established Fairhope on property given to them by Elizabeth's family. The main house was built by Theophilus Gilliam Fowler, a local builder. Construction began in 1857 and was completed by 1861. The 1860 United States Census of Perry County indicates that Joseph Selden owned 80 slaves in that year. Selden organized Selden's Battery, an artillery unit, at his own expense during the American Civil War. The unit saw action in several major engagements, including the battles of Kennesaw Mountain, Franklin and Nashville. Elizabeth Selden died following childbirth in 1868, Joseph died in a hotel fire in 1900. Fairhope continued to be owned by Selden descendants and operated as a farm for another century after their deaths. Architecture. The inspiration for the main house at Fairhope Plantation is thought by architectural historians to be an enlarged adaptation of a design by Alexander Jackson Davis, published in Andrew Jackson Downing 's Cottage Residences in 1842. The house features numerous Gothic Revival details, including intricate bargeboards on the eaves and gables, hood moldings over the doors and windows, octagonal brick chimneys, and central gables topped by finials on all four sides.

The Cameroon Civil Aviation Authority (abbreviated ""CCAA""'; French: Autorité aéronautique) is a public administrative establishment of a technical nature that ensures the implementation of civil aviation regulation policy, the monitoring of air transport and airport development, as well as the control and regulation of civil aviation safety andsecurity. Since its creation in 1999, the CCAA has been the secular arm of the government in coordinating and monitoring civil aviation activities in Cameroon. It is the Civil Aviation Administration of Cameroon. Its head office is in Yaoundé. at the Air Base 101. History. The use of aviation as a means of transporting people and goods flourished considerably in the aftermath of the Second World War, fostered by the implementation of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention). This Convention was signed on 7 December 1944 by 52 States which agreed on certain principles and arrangements, so that international civil aviation could develop in a safe and orderly manner. In addition, the Chicago Convention created the International Civil Aviation Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for the coordination and regulation of international air transport. Between 1945 and 1960, Cameroon embarked on the path of self-determination saw the creation of many airfields, thus allowing the establishment of internal and international air links. Having obtained its independence on January 1, 1960, Cameroon ratified the Chicago Convention on January 15, 1960. Thus, Cameroon has undertaken to assist in achieving the highest achievable degree of uniformity in regulations, standards, procedures and organization relating to personnel, airways and ancillary services, in all matters for which such uniformity facilitates and improves air navigation. In order for Cameroon to fulfil obligations under the Chicago Convention, a Civil Aviation Authority (DAC) housed in the Ministry of Transport was created in 1963. From 1963 to 1998, under the authority of a Director, the DAC was responsible for the development and implementation of government policy on air transport. This structure was also responsible for the design and implementation of air traffic and air transport regulations, the supervision of air navigation, the inspection and control of the operation of airport facilities, the coordination of all activities related to air transport and participation in international conferences within its field of activity. In the ’80s and ’90s, ICAO found that some States were experiencing difficulties in meeting their obligations to oversee the implementation of the standards and recommended practices contained in the Annexes to the Chicago Convention. In this regard, ICAO has mandated States to establish autonomous civil aviation authorities. It is in response to ICAO guidelines that the CCAA was created in favour of Article No. 98/023 of 24 December 1998 on the civil aviation regime in Cameroon, reinforced by its implementing decree No. 99/198 of 16 September 1999. Over time, the missions of the CCAA and the powers of its Director General have been extended through: Missions. The main missions of the CCAA are: Organization. The organizational chart of March 11, 2016, modified and completed in 2017, organizes the CCAA into central services and decentralized services.

It is the fifth largest lake in the province and is approximately 250 kilometres (160 mi) north of Prince Albert, on the edge of the Canadian Shield. La Ronge, Air Ronge, and the Lac La Ronge First Nation are on the western shore. The lake is a popular vacation spot. Recreational activities include fishing, boating, canoeing, hiking, and camping. Recreation and access. Lac La Ronge Provincial Park extends around the lake on three sides, starting at La Ronge and ending along the east shore. The park contains four RV parks, two of which are on the west shore of the lake, one is in the town of Missinipe (Missinipe is the Woodland Cree name for the Churchill River which is on the south-west shore of Otter Lake, which flows through the north side of the park), and the fourth one is on the east shore of Nemeiben Lake. There is also a hunting and fishing lodge 26 kilometres (16 mi) north of La Ronge. Nistowiak Falls, on the Rapid River, which is the lake's primary outflow into the Churchill River and one of the tallest falls in Saskatchewan can be observed by canoe trails on the north side of the park. Highway 2 passes the lake on the west side, ending at La Ronge, where it becomes Highway 102. Stanley Mission can be accessed by Highway 915 on the north side of the park. The community is on the shores of the Churchill River across from the Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Saskatchewan's oldest building. Lac la Ronge Dam. The Lac la Ronge Dam (55°20′09″N 104°32′05″W / 55.3358°N 104.5346°W), which is an embankment dam, was constructed at the source of the Rapid River in 1966 to regulate the lake's water levels. It is 3.7 metres (12 ft) high and contains four gates. The dam was upgraded in 2007 and a fish ladder was installed. Further upgrades were undertaken between 2017 and 2022 at a cost of $2.7 million. The upgrades included ""strengthening the control structure and adding a modern steel structure over the spillway to install and remove stoplogs, along with seepage remediation"". Island ecology. The lake's numerous islands have been the focus of biogeography studies investigating how island size and isolation influence the wildlife inhabiting them. In the northern half of the lake, you'll find over 1,300 ice age-carved granite islands. Fish species. The lake's large bodied fish species include: walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, lake trout, lake whitefish, cisco, white sucker, longnose sucker, and burbot. Unlike other lakes in Saskatchewan, in addition to a provincial angling licence, a special angling endorsement was required to fish on Lac la Ronge from 1997 until 2017. The Lac la Ronge endorsement allowed anglers to keep up to four lake trout annually from the lake. It was put in place to reduce the harvest from sport fishing after the collapse of the lake trout population within Lac la Ronge. The endorsement was available free of charge from the Ministry of Environment office in La Ronge. Beginning in 2015, the Ministry also required anglers to keep a ""Harvest Ledger"", which was given alongside the endorsement to record when Lake Trout were harvested. In May 2017 when the 2017–18 fishing season opened the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment discontinued the endorsement and ""Harvest Ledger"" requirement. Lac la Ronge may now be fished with only a provincial angling licence but has reduced limits for lake trout, northern pike and walleye, along with the mandatory use of barbless hooks."

The song was released via Island Records on 2 February 2018. It features an interpolation of co-writer Lisa Stansfield 's 1989 single ""All Around the World "" and background vocals from artist Kat Meoz. Background and release. The song was first teased on 5 December 2016, with a brief snippet of the song playing on a private jet. That same day, a demo version was leaked featuring a guest appearance from Verse Simmonds instead of Quavo. On 9 January 2018, Azalea announced she would debut the single in a Super Bowl commercial for Monster Cable. She said in a Monster press conference at CES 2018 that the song would be officially released ""around February 1st"". She revealed the song's artwork through social media on 25 January, followed by short clips and behind the scene shots from the song's lyric video. A snippet was posted a day prior to its release, displaying its ""island-themed instrumental"". She explained the meaning and purpose behind the song in a preview video, saying: ""It is not a record about you needing a man or a woman to come and save you in a relationship, it's about you being your own savior and finding your own strength within yourself to figure it the fuck out. It's a really hard record for me to have written and I think it's going to be one I really struggle to perform, too, just 'cause I'll probably wanna cry every single time."" "" was created at a time when I felt so stagnant & alone, but I just couldn't pick up the phone and admit to even my closest friends how hopeless I felt,"" she wrote in a tweet. ""So I hope I can connect with anyone else that's been/going thru it via this song."" Dr. Luke was originally listed as a co-writer and co-producer of the song. Azalea quickly declared via Twitter after causing public backlash, saying that the two producers of the song ""have production agreements with Luke"", and that she is not affiliated with Luke nor working with him. Luke was subsequently removed from the credits. It was then speculated Luke was being credited under a pseudonym. Azalea stated she written the song because "" had a big breakup, and career wasn't going well"". Referencing to her breakup with American basketball player Nick Young. Critical reception. Nick Mojica of XXL wrote that the song was ""made for dance floors with its tropical-inspired house beat"". Rob Arcand of Spin felt that it features ""a low, down-tempo house beat with Quavo at his most melodic, Auto-Tuned self as Iggy aims more for songwriting craftsmanship than rapping acumen this go round"". Live performances. On 16 March 2018, Azalea joined Demi Lovato on stage to perform ""Savior"", with Lovato singing the hook, during the latter's sold out headlining show at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn as a part of the Tell Me You Love Me World Tour. On 20 March 2018, Azalea performed ""Savior"" on The Late Late Show with James Corden alongside a choir-esque group of backup singers for the chorus. As Quavo did not perform the song with her, Azalea performed his parts of the song alongside her backup singers. Azalea performed the song with ""newly pink"" hair, as quoted by Billboard and an ""all-black getup"". Music video. The music video for ""Savior"" was directed by Colin Tilley and was released on March 1, 2018. It takes place inside a ""neon church"" and features a plethora of religious imagery and symbolism such as neon halos and crosses, burning roses, and a scene of Azalea being baptized.

13719242,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._86_Squadron_RAAF,No. 86 Squadron RAAF,"Abstract. No. 86 Squadron was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) fighter squadron of World War II. The squadron was formed in March 1943 and was deployed to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea in July that year. While No. 86 Squadron was stationed at Merauke until April 1944, it saw little combat. After being transferred back to Australia its aircraft and personnel were transferred to other units, and only a nucleus of the squadron remained. While it was re-equipped with new aircraft in June 1945, the war ended before the squadron was ready for combat and it was disbanded in December 1945. History. No. 86 Squadron was formed at Gawler, South Australia, on 4 March 1943 and was equipped with Curtiss P-40M Kittyhawk fighter aircraft. In May that year it moved to Townsville, Queensland, in May where it completed its training. In early July 1943 No. 86 Squadron moved to Merauke in Dutch New Guinea to protect this base against Japanese air attack. Until this point the base had been protected by CAC Boomerang fighters of No. 84 Squadron flying out of Horn Island, but the completion of an airfield at Meruake allowed a Kittyhawk squadron to take on this duty. The decision to station a fighter squadron at Merauke was made in response to concerns that the Japanese could potentially attack and occupy the strategically located settlement, and the Australian Army garrison there was also expanded. While there was generally little Japanese activity in the area by the time the squadron arrived, on 27 July sixteen No. 86 Squadron Kittyhawks were scrambled to intercept four Japanese aircraft which had been detected by radar. The Japanese aircraft were able to leave the area before the squadron could make contact with them, however. A force of 16 Japanese Mitsubishi G4M bombers and the same number of fighters raided Merauke on 9 September and were intercepted by 14 Kittyhawks from No. 86 Squadron. While most of the Kittyhawks suffered gun malfunctions and were unable to engage the Japanese, the squadron shot down two G4Ms and a Nakajima Ki-43 fighter without loss. From September 1943, the RAAF units in the Merauke–Torres Strait area had little to do as few Japanese aircraft operated in the area. No. 86 Squadron next saw combat against Japanese aircraft on 22 and 23 January 1944 when it intercepted and destroyed two G4Ms and one Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter near Cape Valsch; after these engagements the Japanese ceased sending aircraft into the Merauke area. No. 86 Squadron also undertook other tasks in addition to its air defence duties. The squadron regularly conducted patrols of the Merauke area, escorted supply ships and exercised with Australian Army units. It also undertook several ground attack missions, including an operation on 31 January 1944 in which four Japanese barges were sunk in the mouth of the Lorentz River. The official history of the RAAF in this period notes that although the two squadrons on Merauke and Horn Island saw little action, they ""fulfilled a very useful purpose"" by protecting the flank of the Allied forces in New Guinea. The squadron's tour of duty at Merauke ended on 25 April 1944, when it was replaced by No. 120 (NEI) Squadron. No. 86 Squadron subsequently moved to Strauss Airfield in the Northern Territory. Shortly after it arrived, 19 of its Kittyhawks were transferred to No. 77 Squadron. This left the future of the squadron in doubt, and on 26 May it was announced that the unit was to be reduced to a cadre and its personnel used to form No. 5 Repair and Servicing Depot at Bohle River Aerodrome near Townsville, while its remaining Kittyhawks would be transferred to No. 80 Squadron. However, in June it was decided to retain No. 86 Squadron in nucleus form with a strength of two Kittyhawks and 30 personnel. In late June 1944, No. 86 Squadron moved from Bohle River Aerodrome to Macrossan. It received more Kittyhawks and undertook training, and in June 1945 began to be re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters. The squadron established detachments at Merauke and Thursday Island, but the war ended before it could move forward into the combat zones. No. 86 Squadron was disbanded at Bohle River Aerodrome on 20 December 1945."

7320868,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sharrock,Robert Sharrock,"Abstract. Robert Sharrock (1630–1684) was an English churchman and botanist. He is now known for The History of the Propagation and Improvement of Vegetables by the Concurrence of Art and Nature (1660), for philosophical work directed against Thomas Hobbes, and as an associate of Robert Boyle He became Archdeacon of Winchester, in the final year of his life. Life. He was baptised at Drayton Parslow, Buckinghamshire, on 29 June 1630, the son of Robert Sharrock. His father was rector of Drayton Parslow from 1639 to 1642, and of Adstock, Buckinghamshire, from March 1640 till his death in September 1671; his wife's name was Judith. The son Robert was admitted a scholar of Winchester School in 1643, and was elected Fellow of New College, Oxford, on 5 March 1649 by the parliamentary visitors. He matriculated on 16 November 1650, graduated B.C.L. on 12 October 1654, and D.C.L. on 24 May 1661. He was presented to the college rectory of Horwood Magna in Buckinghamshire on 29 June 1665, and was installed prebendary of Winchester on 13 September 1665. In 1668 he exchanged Horwood for the rectory of East Woodhay in Hampshire, which was nearer Winchester, succeeding his younger brother, Edmund (b. 1635), fellow of New College 1658–70. He became rector of Bishop Waltham in Hampshire in 1669, and Archdeacon of Winchester on 18 April 1684 (installed 21 April). He died on 11 July 1684. He married Frances, daughter of Edmund West, who survived him, and, dying on 29 January 1691–2, was buried on 31 January at Bishop Waltham. His son Robert (1680?–1708) bequeathed to the bishopric of Lincoln the advowson of the rectory of Adstock, which had been purchased by his grandfather. Works. Anthony Wood says of Sharrock that he was considered ""learned in divinity, in the civil and common law, and very knowing in vegetables"". Historic interest attaches to his History of the Propagation and Improvement of Vegetables, Oxford, 1660, 1666, 1672, his first published book, as the results of the researches of an early student of natural science, especially botany. It reappeared in London in 1694 with the title An Improvement to the Art of Gardening, or an exact History of Plants. He carried out experimental work, for example testing the opinion of Jacob Bobart the Elder that certain plant species spontaneously mutated. Chapter 5 of the book reports extensive studies on grafting; he carried out practical trials in the Oxford Physick Garden run by Bobart. Sharrock's interests extended to Equisetum, disregarded in his time. He also supplied prefaces to three of the physical treatises of Robert Boyle: Some Considerations touching the Usefulness of Experimental Philosophy (1663); New Experiments Physico-Mechanical (1665); and A Defence of the Doctrine touching the Spring and Weight of the Air (1669). Sharrock edited New Experiments and translated it into Latin. Sharrock's work on political philosophy, Ὑπόθεσις ἠθική, De Officiis secundum Naturae Jus, was directed against Hobbes's views of ethics and politics (Oxford, 1660; Gotha, 1667; Oxford, 1682). It was quoted as of authority by Richard Cumberland in his De Legibus Naturae, and by other philosophical writers. According to Jon Parkin, ""The aim of De officiis was to prove against Hobbes a number of hypotheses on the existence of a hierarchy of duties annexed to natural law""; and the method was to ""transpose"" Hobbes into an Epicurean so as to use against him old arguments of Cicero. Sharrock in doing this was accepting of some of Hobbes's criticism of scholasticism, but also had to distinguish himself from the unacceptable Hobbes. These manoeuvres were a partial prototype for Cumberland's more famous work in the same direction. Hobbes also came in for attack in Sharrock's Judicia and De finibus virtutis, the latter quoting research of Thomas Willis on neurology. Sharrock also published: References."

In some sources he is mentioned as a Catholic priest. Although he was a committed Christian his work does not contain much religious bias. Works. He personally knew Sultan Barquq and spoke Arabic. After he returned to Italy in 1416 he wrote a biography of Barquq and valuable testimony of Timur 's capture of the Mamluk region of Syria in 1400—1401. He wrote his works based on what he had heard about the conquest because he fled to Jerusalem during the siege of Damascus and spent the winter of 1400/1401 there. After he heard that Damascus had been destroyed, he joined the retreating Mamluk Egyptian army commanded by Faraj ibn Barquq and went to Cairo and Alexandria with a servant. In his works he also mentions the Battle of Kosovo because he makes a parallel between the conduct of Stefan Lazarević during the Battle of Angora and his father Prince Lazar of Serbia during the Battle of Kosovo. Like many other early Western sources, Mignanelli believed that the Christian Serbian army was victorious. In his 1416 work Mignanelli asserted that the Ottoman sultan Murad I was killed by Prince Lazar himself. Mignanelli died in 1460."

59853,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroreflector,Retroreflector,"Abstract. A retroreflector (sometimes called a retroflector or cataphote) is a device or surface that reflects radiation (usually light) back to its source with minimum scattering. This works at a wide range of angle of incidence, unlike a planar mirror, which does this only if the mirror is exactly perpendicular to the wave front, having a zero angle of incidence. Being directed, the retroflector's reflection is brighter than that of a diffuse reflector. Corner reflectors and cat's eye reflectors are the most used kinds. Types. There are several ways to obtain retroreflection: Operation. Retroreflectors are devices that operate by returning light back to the light source along the same light direction. The coefficient of luminous intensity, R, is the measure of a reflector performance, which is defined as the ratio of the strength of the reflected light (luminous intensity) to the amount of light that falls on the reflector (normal illuminance). A reflector appears brighter as its R value increases. The R value of the reflector is a function of the color, size, and condition of the reflector. Clear or white reflectors are the most efficient, and appear brighter than other colors. The surface area of the reflector is proportional to the R value, which increases as the reflective surface increases. The R value is also a function of the spatial geometry between the observer, light source, and reflector. Figures 1 and 2 show the observation angle and entrance angle between the automobile's headlights, bicycle, and driver. The observation angle is the angle formed by the light beam and the driver's line of sight. Observation angle is a function of the distance between the headlights and the driver's eye, and the distance to the reflector. Traffic engineers use an observation angle of 0.2 degrees to simulate a reflector target about 800 feet in front of a passenger automobile. As the observation angle increases, the reflector performance decreases. For example, a truck has a large separation between the headlight and the driver's eye compared to a passenger vehicle. A bicycle reflector appears brighter to the passenger car driver than to the truck driver at the same distance from the vehicle to the reflector. The light beam and the normal axis of the reflector as shown in Figure 2 form the entrance angle. The entrance angle is a function of the orientation of the reflector to the light source. For example, the entrance angle between an automobile approaching a bicycle at an intersection 90 degrees apart is larger than the entrance angle for a bicycle directly in front of an automobile on a straight road. The reflector appears brightest to the observer when it is directly in line with the light source. The brightness of a reflector is also a function of the distance between the light source and the reflector. At a given observation angle, as the distance between the light source and the reflector decreases, the light that falls on the reflector increases. This increases the amount of light returned to the observer and the reflector appears brighter. Applications. History. Many prey and predator animals have naturally retroreflective eyes by having a reflective layer called the Tapetum lucidum behind the retina, since this doubles the light that their retina receives. Inspired by the natural world, the inventor of road 'cat's eyes' was Percy Shaw of Boothtown, Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. When the tram-lines were removed in the nearby suburb of Ambler Thorn, he realised that he had been using the polished steel rails to navigate at night. The name ""cat's eye"" comes from Shaw's inspiration for the device: the eyeshine reflecting from the eyes of a cat. In 1934, he patented his invention (patents Nos. 436,290 and 457,536), and on 15 March 1935, founded Reflecting Roadstuds Limited in Halifax to manufacture the items. The name Catseye is their trademark. The retroreflecting lens had been invented six years earlier for use in advertising signs by Richard Hollins Murray, an accountant from Herefordshire and, as Shaw acknowledged, they had contributed to his idea."

24451697,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancho_Muniz,Rancho Muniz,"Abstract. Rancho Muniz (also called ""Maniz"") was a 17,761-acre (71.88 km) Mexican land grant in present-day Sonoma County, California given in 1845 by Governor Pío Pico to Manuel Torres. The grant extended along the Pacific coast from Salt Point State Park on the north to the Russian River on the south. The grant included Fort Ross. History. The Mexican government, which had been concerned about the Russian presence at Fort Ross, was happy to see them leave in 1841, but less pleased when the Russian-American Company sold it to John Sutter. The position of the Mexican government had been that neither land nor improvements had ever belonged to the Russians and hence they could not legally be transferred to anyone else. Within two years after the purchase of Fort Ross, everything Sutter considered salvageable had been removed to his Rancho New Helvetia. In 1843, William (Wilhelm) Benitz, from Baden, Germany, became manager of Sutter's Fort Ross holdings. In 1844 Sutter leased the land to Benitz and a partner, Ernest Rufus, from Württemberg. Both Benitz and Rufus had been in Sutter's militia. That transaction again brought into question the validity of Sutter's title to the property, and Governor Manuel Micheltorena granted Rancho Bodega in part of the southern half of the former Russian claim to Captain Stephen Smith in 1844, and Governor Pio Pico granted the coastal four square league Rancho Muniz in the northern half of the former Russian claim to Manuel Torres in 1845. Manuel Torres (1826–1910) was born in Lima, Peru, and came to California in 1843 on a merchant ship with his brother-in-law, Captain Stephen Smith who was married to his sister, Manuela Garcia Torres. Torres married Mariana (Maryanna) Richardson the daughter of William A. Richardson. Manuel Torres leased Rancho Muniz to Benitz and Rufus, who also owned Rancho German on the Muniz’ northern border, and in 1849, he sold the entire rancho to them. Manuel Torres later operated the Estudillo House in San Leandro, and also the Marin Hotel in San Rafael. Torres was elected to the California State Assembly in 1858-9. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Muniz was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to Manuel Torres in 1860. Benitz and Rufus now owned approximately two thirds of the Sonoma County coastline, from the Gualala River in the north to the Russian River in the south. Rufus left the partnership in June, 1849. William Benitz took another partner, German immigrant, Charles Theodore Meyer. In 1867, John Rule bought 4,000 acres (16.2 km) in the southern half of the rancho. In 1874, Benitz sold all of his property and emigrated to Argentina."

Licensed to Hernando, Florida, USA, the station broadcasts from a three tower directional antenna array located off State Highway 200, just north of Hernando. It is owned by MARC Radio Gainesville, LLC. Its studios are in a single wide mobile home located next to the transmitter towers on North Roscoe Road. Programming is also simulcast on 1430 WTMN in Gainesville. The stations call themselves ""The Shepherd"". WRZN broadcasts at 10,000 watts by day with a non-directional antenna. During daytime operation, the station can be heard in Ocala, Gainesville, and Tampa. But at night, the station reduces power to 250 watts, using a directional antenna because 720 AM is a clear channel frequency reserved for Class A WGN in Chicago. History. WRZN signed on in June 1989, owned by Management and Marketing Synergy Inc, whose principals were Frank Watson and Clay Brinker. Andrew Blackburn was the original Operations Manager that set up operations manual and programming using the Gold format from The Satellite Music Network. In 2000, the station was sold to Pamal Broadcasting as a part of a multi-station market purchase in the Gainesville-Ocala market. WRZN was purchased by Marc Radio in 2011. In early November 2011, WRZN became Fox News Talk 720. In 2016 it switched to a religious format."
32895626,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_encounter_of_Soviet_T-34_and_KV_tanks,German encounter of Soviet T-34 and KV tanks,"Abstract. Prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, the German armed forces were not aware of two newly developed Soviet tanks, the T-34 and the KV. As a result, they were surprised when they met them in combat for the first time in June 1941. The Germans' standard anti-tank weapons were found to be ineffective against these new Soviet vehicles. This experience prompted a notable leap in tank development in Nazi Germany, mainly in an effort to counter these new threats. By 22 June 1941, the Red Army deployed almost 1,000 T-34 and over 500 KV tanks, concentrated in five of their twenty-nine mechanized corps. By the end of December 1941, they had lost 2,300 T-34 and over 900 KV tanks, accounting for 15% of the 20,500 tanks lost that year. Initial encounters. At the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Germans were expecting little from their opponent's tank forces, which were composed of the old T-26 and BTs. While most of the Soviet Union's armoured forces were composed of such tanks, the T-34 and the KV designs, which were previously unknown, took the Germans by surprise. Both types were encountered on the second day of the invasion – 23 June 1941. Half a dozen anti-tank guns fire shells at him, which sound like a drumroll. But he drives staunchly through our line like an impregnable prehistoric monster... It is remarkable that lieutenant Steup's tank made hits on a T-34, once at about 20 meters and four times at 50 meters, with Panzergranate 40 (caliber 5 cm), without any noticeable effect. The KV tanks were usually assigned to the same units as the more numerous T-34 and, although they were much larger, their overall performance was quite similar; many sources discuss the impact of both types. The most common model of KV was the KV-1. It was in the Battle of Raseiniai where German forces encountered the Soviet KV for the first time. The Soviet 2nd Tank Division from the 3rd Mechanized Corps attacked and overran elements of the German 6th Panzer Division near Skaudvilė on 23 June. German Panzer 35(t) light tanks and anti-tank weapons were practically ineffective against the Soviet armoured giants, which closed with and, even though some of them were out of ammunition, destroyed some German anti-tank guns by simply driving over them. The next day, at a crossroads near Raseiniai, Lithuania, a single KV heavy tank managed to block the advance of elements of the 6th Panzer Division, which had established bridgeheads on the Dubysa River. It stalled the German advance for a full day while being attacked by a variety of anti-tank weapons before being overrun after it finally ran out of ammunition. Tank versus tank engagements. Historians initially believed that the new tanks were ""scattered"" among the army in small numbers, but recent research shows the exact opposite. The new tanks were concentrated into dedicated types of formations, such as the mechanized corps. While the re-creating of the mechanised corps had been organised as proposed by Georgy Zhukov, this had not been completed when Nazi Germany attacked in 1941. Originally done under Marshal Tukhachevsky, the mechanised corps had been broken up by the Commissar for Defence Marshal Voroshilov in a misreading of the lessons of the Spanish Civil War and the Winter War with Finland. Voroshilov had been replaced by Marshal Timoshenko as Commissar in May 1940. Zhukov had drawn a different conclusion about armoured warfare from the success of the panzers in France and from his own experience in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against Japan. Among the mechanized corps (MC), four formations were especially well equipped. On the day of German invasion, about 70% of the total T-34 and KV tanks produced at that time were deployed in the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 15th MC. The 6th MC operated in the Białystok area, and all of the others in the Soviet Ukraine. All of their engagements with German tanks happened during or just before the Battle of Brody: Tank-to-tank battles were rare at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa as the Germans did not seek them; they preferred to bypass the Soviet armour whenever possible. The two stand-out formations, the 4th and 6th MCs, lost almost all of their T-34 and KVs during movement, not from any German attack. Both corps tried to assemble counterattacks against German infantry (not against panzers), but the counterattacks had no impact and were barely noticeable. The same pertained to the 15th MC after 26 June. In the first two weeks of the invasion, the Soviet Union suffered the loss of most of its T-34s and KVs, as well as the loss of most of the older tanks: On one hand, these corps had, within weeks, lost most of their T-34s and KVs, but on the other hand, German reports did not note such a massive elimination in combat. The number of non-combat losses was unprecedented. German anti-tank capability. In the first weeks of the invasion, the main German anti-tank and tank weapon was the 3.7 cm Pak 36, the 5 cm KwK 38 and 5 cm KwK 39, as well as the short-barreled, howitzer-like German 7.5 cm KwK 37 gun. The new 5 cm Pak 38 had just begun to enter service in small numbers, with a maximum of two weapons per infantry regiment. German tank guns proved to be somewhat ineffective at greater range and within the lethality envelope of the F-34 tank gun used by the T-34 and KV-1. Generally, the T-34 outclassed the existing Panzer III and short-barreled Panzer IV medium tanks. Attempts to destroy the T-34s and KVs concentrated on first immobilising them by firing at their tracks and then by tackling them with field artillery, anti-aircraft guns, or by blowing them up at close range by shaped charge grenades. Impact on tank design worldwide. On 4 October 1941, the 4th Panzer Division, part of General Heinz Guderian 's Panzer Group 2 suffered a severe setback at Mtsensk, near Oryol. Heinz Guderian demanded an inquiry into the realities of tank warfare on the Eastern Front, suggesting that the quickest solution was to produce a direct copy of the T-34. A special Panzerkommision arrived on the Eastern Front on 20 November 1941 to assess the T-34. The Weapons Department held that Germany would have difficulty copying the T-34 as Guderian had suggested, because of the quantity of steel alloy and diesel engines required. Hence a new German medium tank was proposed, incorporating three features of the T-34: a long overhanging gun, good off-road mobility from large tracks, and sloped glacis armour to give greater protection with a modest thickness of armour. Daimler-Benz and MAN were asked to develop a 30-tonne tank, Daimler-Benz with their VK 30.02 (D) and MAN with their VK 30.02 (M), incorporating a new Rheinmetall turret. Hitler preferred the Daimler-Benz, but the Weapons Department preferred the MAN, which was more like earlier German tanks. Originally, the VK20, a new 20-tonne tank, had been proposed in 1938 as the next German tank, but this project was clearly inadequate now. In May 1942, MAN was contracted to produce pre-production prototypes, although the Panther tank did not enter production until 1943, and the Model D Panther with increased thickness of armour now weighed 44.8 tonnes. Their combat deployment in June 1943 for Operation Citadel was a debacle. The larger Tiger I heavy tank was also in use by this time."

Mighty Atom (鉄腕アトム, Tetsuwan Atomu) is a side-scrolling platform game published by Konami based on the manga and anime franchise Mighty Atom (Astro Boy in English) by Osamu Tezuka. The game was released exclusively in Japan for the Famicom on February 26, 1988. Gameplay. The game consists of a total of ten stages, which the player must traverse in a side scrolling, platforming fashion, while figuring out riddles along the way. The game's objective is to recover the money that was stolen from Professor Ochanomizu 's lab. Instead of the usual extra lives, Atom's remaining life energy is determined by the amount of uranium (abbreviated ""uran"" in the game) he has left in his disposal. Atom begins each stage with 300 uran points, that will gradually decrease with each second. Every time Atom gets hit by certain enemies, falls from a pitfall, or runs out of time, the professor will use his remaining uran points to rebuild Atom. The player can also summon the professor during gameplay to replenish their uran points. The game ends if both, Atom and the professor, use up all of their uran points. Atom's actions consists of a standard jump and punch attack, as well as the ability to fly through the air for a limited period. To fly, the player must hold down the directional pad left or right while jumping three times in a row. The player can also collect coins by finding them in hidden places or hitting certain enemies, allowing the player to buy some extra items, including more uranium in case the player gets a Game Over, allowing them to continue. There are some hidden souvenirs throughout the game as well, which reward extra points if brought to the end of the stage they are found in."

Historical significance. A marker near titled ""Lee's Last Attack"" says: ""At a last council of war held on Saturday, April 8, Lee ordered Gordon's infantry and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry to clear the stage road of Union cavalry. The Union horsemen were pushed back but arrival of bluecoated infantry again blocked the escape route. A flag of truce halted the fighting while General Lee negotiated the surrender of his army."" Description and architecture. The single story Mariah Wright House is topped with a gable roof and attic. The structure is roughly forty feet deep by eighteen feet wide. The west side of the house has a full length front porch and a central east porch of sixteen and a half feet by seven and a half feet. Both porches are on stone piers with wood shingle shed roofs. The house siding is beaded pine weatherboard. The Mariah Wright House had an attached kitchen wing added around 1890. In 1965 the National Park Service restored the house, removing the kitchen wing and excavating a basement and full cement foundation. Extensive archeological investigations were conducted at this time and many artifacts were found. Sources."

17255967,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_York_Gaol,Old York Gaol,"Abstract. The Old York Gaol is a former colonial prison at Lindsay Road and Main Street (United States Route 1A) in York, Maine. Its oldest portion dating to about 1720, it is one of the oldest prison buildings in the United States, and one of the oldest public buildings in the state of Maine. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968. It is owned by the Museums of Old York and is open for tours between May and October. Description and history. The gaol is a largely wood frame structure that has had a long evolutionary history of growth and change, and presently appears as a 1-1/2 story gambrel-roofed structure that is partial clapboarded, with sections of stone wall. The oldest portion of the building, dating to 1719 or 1720, is a stone cell block containing a single cell, with stone walls 2.5 feet (0.76 m) thick lined on the inside with oak planking. About 1736 several first-floor chambers were added, including a kitchen, dining room, and parlor space that has a folding partition wall (added late in the 19th century), so that it be divided into two separate rooms. In c. 1763 the second floor was added, with three cells and a central chamber. One of the cells, surmised to be intended for use as a debtor's cell or warden's room, is of noticeably finer quality. Around the turn of the 19th century a second stone cell was added to the first floor, along with an extension including a dining room, parlor, and bedchamber for the warden. The original portion of the jail was constructed using timbers from the earlier York jail built in 1656. The building served as the official provincial jail for York County (then part of Massachusetts) until 1760, when it was turned over to the town of York. The building's last major enlargement was made in response to a demand for better conditions in debtor's prisons after an increase in debtors following the American Revolution. After 1879 the building was used as a school, warehouse, and boarding house until 1900 when it opened as a colonial museum of relics. The Old Gaol continues to be a museum and reflects the jail and jailer's quarters as they were in 1789."

It is opposite Padstow on the north-east bank of the River Camel estuary. The village is in the civil parish of St Minver Lowlands about 4 miles (6.4 km) north-west of Wadebridge. Toponymy. The original name recorded in 1303 was Penmayn, Cornish for 'the end or head of stones'. An alternative, Blaketorre ('Black Tor'), is found in 1337. This had become Black Rock by the 18th century and was subsequently shortened to Rock. The name of the ferry that operates between Rock and Padstow recalls the old place name. Geography. The main residential area is set back from the coast along the road from Pityme and St Minver. To the northeast, Rock is contiguous with the settlements of Splatt and Pityme. Stoptide is a southern extension of Rock. Rock is best known for its estuary frontage. To the northwest, the road runs beside the estuary as a cul de sac giving access to the ferry boarding point and an intertidal beach backed by sand dunes which at low water extend for two miles past Brea Hill to Daymer Bay. To the south is the small coastal settlement of Porthilly with St Michael's Church situated on the bank of Porthilly Cove. Tourism. Rock is popular with holidaymakers and in 1881 the hotel was enlarged, a new sea-wall built and a bathing house erected on the beach. In the same year Silvanus Trevail designed and built two large villas. It is now a well-established centre for water sports including dinghy racing, waterskiing, windsurfing, and sailing. Rock Sailing Club's headquarters, in a converted warehouse on a wharf, is a local landmark. Rock Lifeboat Station was established in 1994. Rock has Cornwall's highest proportion of second homes in the county. The Black Tor Ferry operates across the river to the town of Padstow, and this is a major source of tourist traffic through Rock. The early 21st century has seen extensive building work and increased prosperity for Rock, there are a large number of holiday homes, as well as a number of retail outlets. Rock is also home to Sharp's Brewery, a real ale brewery established as an independent in the mid 1990s, but taken over by Molson Coors in 2011 to secure the Doom Bar bitter brand. Rock has been referred to as 'Britain's Saint-Tropez ' and the 'Kensington of Cornwall' due to its popularity with affluent holidaymakers. The Daily Telegraph has also called it Chelsea-on-Sea and stated that David Cameron's favourite beer is brewed there. Affluent visitors such as Mohamed Al-Fayed and Jay Kay of Jamiroquai often arrive by helicopter."

60472453,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriaan_Teding_van_Berkhout,Adriaan Teding van Berkhout,"Abstract. Adriaan Teding van Berkhout (Hoorn, 1571 or 1572? — The Hague, 13 August 1620) was an eminent Dutch jurist, justice in the Hof van Holland, and politician of the Dutch Republic. He was a friend of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, who tried to warn the latter of his impending arrest before the Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets. Personal life. Adriaan was born the son of Hoorn burgomaster Jan Teding van Berkhout and Levina de Huybert. He was educated at a latin school in Leiden and subsequently studied law at Leiden University where he was enrolled as a student under the name Hadrianus Berckhout on 11 February 1588. He received his doctoral law degree from the University of Orléans on 10 April 1595. He married Geertruid van Gael in Monnikendam in 1597, with whom he had one son (Volkert), and after her death, on 25 May 1604 with Margaretha Duyst van Beresteyn in Delft. With the latter he had the following children: Lidia (who died young), Johan (who was deaf-mute), Paulus, Lydia (who married Govert Brasser, pensionary of Delft), Geertruid (who married Hugo Brasser, baljuw of Haringskerspel), Cornelia (who married lieutenant-admiral Maarten Harpertsz. Tromp), Maria (who married Nicolaas de Bye, pensionary of Monnikendam and later justice in the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland), and Margaretha (who married jonkheer Jan van Egmond van den Nieuburg, schepen of Alkmaar and bewindhebber of the VOC). Career. After finishing his studies Adriaan was appointed pensionary of the city of Monnikendam in 1596 and promoted to treasurer of that city on 29 September 1598. On 6 May 1605 he was enrolled in the court of audit of the States of Holland and West Friesland, for which he moved to The Hague. There he became a member of the Court of Audit of the Dutch Republic on 31 March 1611. On 6 May 1613 he was appointed a member of the Council of State. On 28 March 1614 he was appointed justice in the Hof van Holland. As such he was part of a commission that was sent in 1615 by the States of Holland to mediate in a conflict within the city government of Leeuwarden. In 1614 the States of Holland promulgated a Resolution entitled ""For the Peace of the Church"", promoted by Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius to enforce toleration between partisans of two warring theologians, Jacobus Arminius (who called themselves the ""Remonstrants ') and Franciscus Gomarus (who were called the ""Counter-Remonstrants""). The enforcement of this Resolution caused discord within the Hof van Holland, with Rombout Hogerbeets and Reinoud van Brederode, the president of the Hoge Raad, joined by Adriaan, opposing Counter-Remonstrant sympathizers on the court. The conflict escalated after the States of Holland adopted the Sharp Resolution. Adriaan was a good friend of Oldenbarnevelt and when the States General authorized the stadtholder and Captain general of the Dutch States Army Maurice, Prince of Orange to arrest Oldenbarnevelt on 28 August 1618, Adriaan went to warn the latter of the impending arrest together with another member of the court. But Oldenbarnevelt ignored the warning and was arrested the next morning. The following trial brought peril for Adriaan also, because he had imprudently written a compromising letter to Oldenbarnevelt that was found during a search of the latter's correspondence by one of the judges in the trial, Albert Bruinink (a colleague of Adriaan). But Bruinink returned the letter to Adriaan without denouncing him. Adriaan was one of the investors in the venture of the draining of the Beemster polder. He invested also in the Magelaanse Compagnie (one of the would-be competitors of the VOC) Adriaan died on 13 August 1620 in The Hague. He was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk (Delft), where a Memorial Tablet for him was hung that appears on a 1661 painting of the church interior by Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet Notes and references."
61002553,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_Against_Torture,Committee Against Torture,"Abstract. The Committee Against Torture (CAT) is a treaty body of human rights experts that monitors implementation of the United Nations Convention against Torture by state parties. The committee is one of eight UN-linked human rights treaty bodies. All state parties are obliged under the convention to submit regular reports to the CAT on how rights are being implemented. Upon ratifying the convention, states must submit a report within one year, after which they are obliged to report every four years. The committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the state party in the form of ""concluding observations."" Under certain circumstances, the CAT may consider complaints or communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the convention have been violated. The CAT usually meets in April/May and November each year in Geneva. Members are elected to four-year terms by state parties and can be re-elected if nominated. Tasks and activities. Rules of Procedure of the CAT. In order to carry out its duties as defined in Part II FoC, the committee established a Rules of Procedure (VerfO) governing the organization, procedures and responsibilities of the committee (Article 18 (2) FoK). It is also based on the Addis Ababa directive on the independence and impartiality of UN treaty bodies. It consists of 2 parts, Part I. General Provisions and Part II. Provisions relating to the tasks of the committee. It is further subdivided into 19 chapters and contains 121 rules (version /C/3/Rev.6). These are numbered and in a revision of the VerfO the rules get new numbers. In the revision on February 21, 2011, in Chap. 17 and 21 introduced a follow-up procedure to review the implementation of the committee's recommendations, stating that states ignored its recommendations. The relevant chapters of the VerfO are: Examination of the state reports. The predominant activity is to examine the statements of account of the contracting states, in which they must state how they implemented the contract(Art. 19 FoK). The course of the examination is described in chap. 17 of the VerfO regulated. The states must submit an initial report to the committee within one year of the conclusion of the contract, followed by a periodic report about every four years thereafter. If a state does not submit a report, the committee notes this in its annual report to the United Nations General Assembly (Resolution 67 RMA). Due to the overloading of the committees, the Simplified Reporting Procedure was introduced by the UN General Assembly. If no material shortcomings have been identified at the time of the last review of a country report, the committee can now proceed with the simplified procedure, in which it issues to the contracting parties a list of issues before reporting (LOIPR). Replies to LOIs) are then considered as periodic state reports (Rule 66 RMA). Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and national human rights organizations (NHRIs) can also actively participate in the state reporting process and submit parallel reports to the state reports in order to show that the implementation of the civil pact by the contracting states is insufficient. In the process, gaps or errors in the state report can be clarified and deficits pointed out. The report review takes place in public meetings in which the committee examines whether the state party correctly implemented the Torture Convention and how it could remedy existing shortcomings (Rule 70 RMA). For the participation of third parties in the public hearing, an admission is required (English Accreditation). If a state fails to file a report despite being warned, the committee examines the implementation of the FoK based on the parallel reports submitted by the NGOs and NHRIs and notes this in its annual report to the UN General Assembly (Rule 67 RMA). If the committee determines during the audit that the state has failed to implement the agreement, it may submit proposals to remedy the deficiencies (Article 19 (3) FoK, Rule 71 of the VerfO). These proposals are called Concluding Observations. These proposals of the CCPR are not legally binding, implementation can not be enforced and only a follow-up procedure is foreseen, in which a rapporteur examines the implementation by the state (Rule 72 RMA). If necessary, the same proposals will be made at the next state report. Since some states are late in submitting their reports, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) has drawn up a list of states submitting their reports on time (e.g. Italy, Switzerland, etc.) and a list of those who are in Arrears (e.g. Germany, Liechtenstein, Austria, the Vatican etc.). Investigation process. The Anti-torture Convention also includes an inquiry procedure which empowers the committee to conduct investigations when reliable information is available on serious or systematic NPT violations by a state party and seeks the cooperation of the state party concerned (Article 20) FoK). This examination procedure is regulated in Chapter 19 of the VerfO. The condition for this is that the state explicitly rejected this when ratifying the treaty (Article 28 (1) FoK). The state is asked by the committee to participate in the investigation proceedings and to provide information on these suspicions (Article 20 (1) FoK, Rule 82 et seq. First of all, the information received is examined (Rule 81 et seq. Of the VerfO) and, if the suspicion has been substantiated, an investigation is carried out, in which case the committee can also conduct investigations in the affected state if the state agrees. Upon completion of the investigation, the committee will send the investigation report to the state concerned and, if it finds any instances of maladministration, appropriate recommendations on how to remedy them (Rule 89 RCD). To date, 10 such studies have been performed. These were: Egypt (2017), Lebanon (2014), Nepal (2012), Brazil (2008), Serbia and Montenegro (2004), Mexico (2003), Sri Lanka (2002), Peru (2001), Egypt (1996), Turkey (1994) The recommendations of the committee are not legally binding, their implementation can not be enforced. Apart from the fact that he can carry out a follow-up procedure to review the implementation of the recommendations or that the implementation of the recommendations will be discussed in the next state report, no further measures are foreseen (Article 20 (5) FoK, Rule 90). If the committee is confronted with such serious or systematic torture by a state, it may also bring the matter to the attention of the UN General Assembly. The latter then decide on the further course of action, because extensive or systematic violations of the torture prohibition are considered crimes against humanity according to Art. 7 (1) of the Rome Statute and the International Criminal Court in The Hague is responsible for this, provided that the fallible state does not the International Criminal Court. State Cases. This procedure is regulated in Chapter 20 of the VerfO. The committee is empowered to consider cases of state where a contracting state claims that another state party is failing to fulfill its obligations under the Convention against Torture (Article 21 FoK). The condition for this is that both states explicitly recognized the competence of the committee when ratifying the treaty (Article 21 (1) FoK, Rule 91, 97 VerO). In contrast to individual complaints, there are no high formal requirements for state complaints, and the UNHCHR Secretariat is not authorized to declare state complaints inadmissible, as in the case of individual complaints (Art. 22 (5) FoK Individual Complaints, Rule 111 ff. The task of the committee is to settle the dispute (Article 21 (1) lit e FoK, Rule 98 of the Rules of Procedure). If no amicable agreement is reached, a final report will be prepared, completing the procedure for the committee (Article 21 (1) (h), (ii) FoK, Rule 101 of the VerfO). For international disputes, there are rules, u. a. the agreement for the peaceful settlement of international disputes The states can then turn to the International Court of Justice within six months, provided that neither of the two states made a reservation in the ratification of the treaty (Article 30 FoK). As a precautionary measure, 12 states rejected the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice when concluding the contract (Article 30 (1) FoK). States do not necessarily have to refer to the International Court of Justice, there is also a European Convention on the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes. For example, on 16 December 1971, Ireland lodged a complaint against England with the ECMR for failing to comply with the prohibition of torture under Article 3 of the ECHR. Ireland could not file the complaint with either the CAT or the CCPR (Article 7 IpbpR), as they did not enter into force until about 10 years later. General remarks. The committee publishes general comments on the interpretation and specification of the various provisions of the Torture Convention. They are intended to clear up misunderstandings and to assist the contracting states in the fulfillment of their contractual obligations. To date, the committee has written four General Comments (GC). Members of the CAT. The members appointed under Art. 17 FoK for four years each Decisions of the CAT. The figures are without the complaints already rejected by the Secretariat of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).The individual decisions can also be found in the database of the UNO.

A regular PV for ""Voyage"" does not exist; however, Tsuki ni Shizumu, a short film starring Hamasaki was created for which ""Voyage"" was used as the theme song. The video starts with a young woman named Minamo (played by Hamasaki) is at a mental institution and has recurring detailed visions of a traumatizing past life. Her visions include a lake with a large image of the moon shining down over it. She is crying tears of blood as she slowly sinks into the lake. She hears someone calling her name ""Kagari"" which was her name in her past life. At the mental hospital she eventually stumbles across a visitor which causes her to go wild and reach out to him as if she had already known him. The doctor believes that Minamo died a traumatizing death in her previous life and therefore she needs to become reunited with her soul mate in this life. In her past life, there is a deranged madwoman who insists that Kagari (Minamo) must be sacrificed to the moon because a special full moon was approaching which only showed up once every hundred years. When the madwoman shows up with her goons to kill Kagari and sacrifice her to the moon, Kagari's soul mate Sonshin (played by Yūsuke Iseya) shows up to try and defend her. Kagari and Sonshin get away from the fiends and spend one final loving moment together. Soon after, the psychopathic woman and her group of minions track Kagari down and brutally kill Sonshin for trying to defend Kagari. Eventually the demented woman ends up getting Kagari and sacrificing her to the moon once and for all. This leads to a gorgeous scene in which Kagari sinks into the shining light of the moon on a lake. Back in the present time, Minamo finds the lake where she was traumatically sacrificed to the moon in her past life. She meets up with the visitor from the hospital who was also the man in her visions: Sonshin, or Shōgo (in present). They briefly speak and realize that they were in fact each others' soul mates and become reunited for good. The video ends with Minamo and Shōgo hugging. Charts. Oricon sales chart (Japan)"

3720182,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hirshhorn,Joseph Hirshhorn,"Abstract. Joseph Herman Hirshhorn (August 11, 1899 – August 31, 1981) was an entrepreneur, financier, and art collector. Biography. Born in Mitau, Latvia, the twelfth of thirteen children, Hirshhorn emigrated to the United States with his widowed mother at the age of six. Hirshhorn went to work as an office boy on Wall Street at age 14. Three years later, in 1916, he became a stockbroker and earned $168,000 that year. A shrewd investor, he sold off his Wall Street investments two months before the collapse of 1929, realizing $4 million in cash. Hirshhorn made his fortune in the mining and oil business. In the 1930s, he focused much of his attention on gold and uranium mining prospects in Canada, establishing an office in Toronto in 1933. In the 1950s, he and geologist Franc Joubin were primarily responsible for the ""Big Z"" uranium discovery in northeastern Ontario and the subsequent founding of the city of Elliot Lake. Hirshhorn Avenue, a residential street in that city, is named after him. By 1960, when he sold the last of his uranium stock, he had made over $100 million in cash from the uranium business. From 1961 to 1976, Hirshhorn lived in a three-story Norman chateau in a 22-acre (89,000 m) estate at the summit of Round Hill, a 550-foot (170 m) rise in north-central Greenwich, Connecticut, with a view of the Manhattan skyline. Art collecting. When Hirshhorn began to make money, he began to buy art, both paintings and sculpture. He amassed a collection of paintings and sculptures from the 19th and 20th centuries. Applying himself seriously to the study of art, he would question dealers, critics, and curators, and visit artists in their studios. He made quick decisions on buying a piece. ""If you've got to look at a picture a dozen times before you make up your mind"", he once said, ""there's something wrong with you or the picture"". Hirshhorn graced his Greenwich mansion with paintings by Joseph Glasco (and sculpture), Willem de Kooning, Raphael Soyer, Jackson Pollock, Larry Rivers, and Thomas Eakins, and the grounds outside with sculptures by Auguste Rodin, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Alberto Giacometti, Alexander Calder, Richard Bernstein (artist), George Rickey, and Henry Moore. He allowed many nonprofit groups to use tours of his sculpture garden for fundraising. In 1966 Hirshhorn donated much of his collection, consisting of 6,000 paintings and sculptures from the 19th and 20th centuries (and constituting one of the world's largest private art treasures), to the United States government, along with a $2 million endowment. The Smithsonian Institution established the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., in 1966 to hold the collection; the museum opened in 1974. At Hirshhorn's death in 1981, he willed an additional 6,000 works and a $5 million endowment to the museum. Controversy. His business dealings in Canada were not without controversy. He was investigated by the Ontario Securities Commission, convicted twice of breaking Canadian foreign exchange laws, deported from Canada for illegal stock manipulation (which he later appealed and won by having himself declared a landed immigrant), and fined for an illegal securities sale and illegally smuggling cash out of Canada. Personal life. Hirshhorn's first wife was Jennie Berman. They were married in 1922 and separated in 1941 (19 years). They had four children, daughters Robin Gertrude (b. 1923), Gene Harriet (b. 1926), and Naomi Caryl (b. 1931), and son Gordon (b. 1929). He was married to portraitist and book illustrator Lily Harmon from 1947–1956 (9 years). The couple adopted two daughters, Amy (b. 1948) and Jo Ann (b. 1951). Hirshhorn's third wife was Brenda Hawley Heide. In 1964 he married his fourth wife, Olga Zatorsky. He remained married to her until his death in 1981"

163234,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"Abstract. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling and the second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry 's second year at Mogwarts School of Looksmaxxing and Bonesmashery, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the ""Chamber of Secrets "" has been opened and that the ""heir of Slytherin "" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks. The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices. Several commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-human, non-magical, and non-living people. Some commentators regard the story's diary that writes back as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became (at the time) the fifth highest-grossing film ever and received generally favourable reviews. Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews. Plot. While spending the summer at the Dursleys, twelve-year-old Harry Potter is visited by Dobby, a house-elf. He says Harry is in danger and must not return to Hogwarts. Harry refuses, so Dobby magically ruins Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's dinner party. Unaware of Dobby's visit, a furious Uncle Vernon locks Harry in his room. The Ministry of Magic sends a notice accusing Harry of performing underage magic and threatening dismissal from Hogwarts. The three Weasley brothers, Ron, Fred and George, arrive in their father 's flying Ford Anglia and rescue Harry, taking him to their home. Harry and the Weasley family travel to Diagon Alley for school supplies. They run into Hermione Granger and meet Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco, and also Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer and adventurer who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. At King's Cross station, Harry and Ron cannot enter Platform 9¾ and miss the Hogwarts Express. They fly in Mr Weasley 's car to Hogwarts, crashing into the Whomping Willow on school grounds and damaging Ron's wand. The car then escapes into the forest. Later, Harry is the only one who hears a strange voice emanating from the castle walls. Soon after, Mr Filch 's cat, Mrs Norris, is found petrified, along with a bloody warning scrawled on a wall: ""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware"". Salazar Slytherin, one of the school's founders, created the Chamber after a dispute with fellow founders on admitting Muggle-born students. Some in the wizarding community disdain Muggle-born wizards like Hermione, believing pure-bloods are superior. The Chamber supposedly houses a monster that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. During a Quidditch game, a rogue Bludger strikes Harry, breaking his arm. Lockhart blunders an attempt to repair it, sending Harry to the hospital overnight. Dobby visits Harry and reveals he jinxed the Bludger and sealed the portal at King's Cross. He says the Chamber of Secrets was once opened years before. Dobby also tells Harry that house-elfs like himself serve one master their entire life, and cannot be freed unless given proper clothing. After another attack, students attend a defensive duelling class, during which Harry exhibits a rare ability to speak 'Parseltongue ', the language of snakes. Harry, Ron, and Hermione suspect Draco is the Heir, given his hostility toward Muggle-borns. Hermione brews Polyjuice Potion, allowing Harry and Ron to impersonate Draco's lackeys Crabbe and Goyle. They learn that Draco knows nothing about the heir. Meanwhile, Moaning Myrtle, a ghost that haunts a girls' bathroom, shows the trio a diary left in her stall. It belonged to Tom Riddle, a student who witnessed another student's death during the Chamber's previous opening. Riddle's consciousness within the diary claims that Hagrid was responsible. Hermione is petrified in the next attack. The school is put on lockdown and may close. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore is forced out and Hagrid is sent to Azkaban prison. Following instructions left by Hagrid, Harry and Ron follow spiders into the Forbidden Forest. They encounter Aragog, a gigantic Acromantula which denies its involvement, and claims spiders fear the real monster. Aragog attempts to feed Harry and Ron to its progeny, but Mr Weasley's car rescues them. Harry and Ron discover that Hermione deduced the monster is a basilisk – a gigantic snake whose direct gaze kills and petrifies victims when seen in a reflection. The basilisk is the voice in the walls, and it travels through the plumbing. Moaning Myrtle was the student that was killed. Ron's sister Ginny is abducted and taken into the Chamber. Harry and Ron discover the entrance in Myrtle's bathroom, and force Lockhart to enter it with them. Lockhart confesses he is a fraud who made up all of his stories and attempts to erase the boys' memories after stealing Ron's damaged wand. The spell backfires, obliterating his own memory, and causes a cave-in; Ron is separated from Harry and stays behind to help Lockhart. Harry proceeds to the Chamber and finds an unconscious Ginny. A manifestation of Tom Riddle reveals he is Lord Voldemort and the Heir of Slytherin. He opened the Chamber and framed Hagrid. He has been using the diary to possess and control Ginny, who had been behaving strangely. The basilisk appears to kill Harry. Dumbledore's phoenix Fawkes arrives, bringing Harry the Sorting Hat. Fawkes blinds the basilisk and Harry pulls the Sword of Godric Gryffindor from the Hat. He slays the basilisk but is poisoned by its venom. As Riddle taunts the dying Harry, Fawkes' tears heal Harry. Harry stabs Riddle's diary with a severed basilisk fang, destroying it and Riddle's body, and reviving Ginny. Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart return to the castle. Harry gives the diary to Dumbledore. Lucius bursts in, furious that Dumbledore returned. He is accompanied by Dobby, who is the Malfoys' house-elf and was working to protect Harry. Harry realizes that Lucius slipped the diary into Ginny's cauldron while they were in Diagon Alley to open the Chamber. Harry tricks Lucius into freeing Dobby from servitude by giving him a sock; Lucius attempts to attack Harry in revenge, but Dobby repels him. The petrified students are cured, Gryffindor wins the House Cup again, Hagrid is released, Lockhart is confined to St. Mungo's Hospital, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in high spirits. Publication and reception. Main themes. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets continues to examine what makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As well as maintaining that Harry's identity is shaped by his decisions rather than any aspect of his birth, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart ""lacks any real identity"" because he is nothing more than a charming liar. Riddle also complicates Harry's struggle to understand himself by pointing out the similarities between the two: ""both half-bloods, orphans raised by Muggles, probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin."" Opposition to class, death and its impacts, experiencing adolescence, sacrifice, love, friendship, loyalty, prejudice, and racism are constant themes of the series. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human Dobby and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick. According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents. Edward Duffy, associate professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books. Immorality and the portrayal of authority as negative are significant themes in the novel. Marguerite Krause states there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter's world, for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he considers it necessary – very like his enemy Draco Malfoy. At the end of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Dumbledore retracts his promise to punish Harry and Ron if they break any more school rules – after Professor McGonagall estimates they have broken over 100 – and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat from the Chamber of Secrets. Krause further states that authority figures and political institutions receive little respect from Rowling. William MacNeil of Griffith University, Queensland, Australia states that the Minister for Magic is presented as a mediocrity. In his article ""Harry Potter and the Secular City"", Ken Jacobson suggests the Ministry as a whole is portrayed as a tangle of bureaucratic empires, saying that ""Ministry officials busy themselves with minutiae (e.g. standardising cauldron thicknesses) and coin politically correct euphemisms like 'non-magical community' (for Muggles) and 'memory modification' (for magical brainwashing)."" This novel implies it begins in 1992: the cake for Nearly-Headless Nick's 500th deathday party bears the words ""Sir Nicholas De Mimsy Porpington died 31 October 1492"". Adaptations."

The Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) is an agency of the state of Oklahoma created to control, develop, and maintain the Grand River waterway. It was created by the Oklahoma state legislature in 1935, and is headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma. GRDA was designed to be self-funding from the sales of electricity and water. The state of Oklahoma was to provide no funding from taxes. The Authority was authorized to issue revenue bonds to fund large-scale capital investments. According to GRDA's 2012 Annual Report, the agency had nearly US $412 million in operating revenue for 2012, compared to nearly US $395.5 million in 2011. It operates three hydroelectric facilities and two reservoirs, Grand Lake, Lake Hudson, and the Salina Pumped Storage Project, which includes W. R. Holway Reservoir, It also owns and operates the GRDA Energy Center (formerly named the GRDA Coal-Fired Complex). The Energy Control Center, home of the GRDA's System Operations Center, is at the Robert S. Kerr Dam, just north of Locust Grove, Oklahoma. In July 2016, it absorbed the mission of the Oklahoma Scenic Rivers Commission to manage, preserve and protect the waters of the scenic Illinois River. Its joint ventures include the Canadian Hills wind farm. GRDA's jurisdiction covers 24 counties in northeastern Oklahoma. History. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture credits Henry Holderman, a member of the Cherokee tribe, as first envisioning Grand River as a source for hydroelectric power for the Cherokee Nation. Even prior to Oklahoma statehood in 1907, Holderman began building political support for such a project. A feasibility study by the Army Corps of Engineers attracted favorable attention in the Oklahoma legislature, leading to creation of the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA), a state agency, in 1935. Construction began in 1938 on the Pensacola Dam on the Grand River (lower Neosho River) as a Works Progress Administration project. The dam was completed in March 1940, creating the lake behind it. Between 1941 and 1946, the U.S. government took control of Pensacola Dam to divert power to the war effort. Control was returned to the GRDA by the Congress and President Truman amid local celebration in August 1946. The second hydroelectric facility built by GRDA was the Markham Ferry project. In 1961, the Markham Ferry dam (since renamed as the Robert S. Kerr Dam) was begun downstream of Pensacola Dam on the Grand River. The lake it impounded was named Lake Hudson. The project was completed in 1964. The powerhouse has four hydroelectric turbines, providing a total capacity of 114,000 kW. GRDA states that an average year can provide 211 million kWh. The Salina Pumped Storage Project constructed for GRDA during 1968 - 1971, created Lake W. R. Holway. It was designed to produce 260 MW of power during peak consumption periods. During periods of lower power demand, water is pumped from Lake Hudson to Lake Holway and released back down through the pump-generators during periods of high energy demand. In the late 1970s, the Authority decided to build the GRDA Coal-fired Power Generation Complex, located near Chouteau, Oklahoma. Now more than four decades old, the two units need extensive retrofits to meet new emission regulations and to improve energy efficiency with more modern technologies. In 2008, GRDA, Oklahoma Gas & Electric (OG&E) and Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA) jointly purchased the Redbud Generation facility near Luther, Oklahoma for 434.5 million. The facility uses natural-gas fueled turbines to generate electricity. Rated capacity was 1230 MW. GRDA owns 36 percent of the venture, while OG&E owns 51 percent and is designated as the operator. OMPA owns the balance. GRDA broke ground in 2013 for a new visitors' center adjacent to Pensacola Dam. The building was designed to be the home of GRDA Ecosystems Management offices, a state-of-the-art water research lab, offices for the Grand Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, a community auditorium and historical exhibits. On June 13, 2012, GRDA approved becoming a member of the Large Public Power Council (LPPC). The LPPC consists of the largest publicly owned not-for-profit, electric utilities in the U.S. LPPC’s priorities include tax and finance issues, interaction with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, energy and environmental policies. Recent developments. Organization. Budget and Personnel. Standard & Poor's (S&P) Rating Services upgraded GRDA's credit rating in 2007 from ""BBB+"" to ""A−"", and improved the outlook from ""stable"" to ""positive"". While GRDA has received three rating outlook improvement from rating agencies in recent years, S&P's announcement was historic, marking the first rating upgrade in GRDA's history. The Fitch Rating Service followed suit in 2008. The A− rating was still in effect at the end of 2012, meaning that GRDA has very favorable terms for borrowing money. According to GRDA's 2012 Annual Report, the agency had nearly US $412 million in operating revenue for 2012, compared to nearly US $395.5 million in 2011. GRDA, as of Fiscal Year 2009, had an annual operating budget of $314 million and employed 450 employees (390 classified and 60 unclassified)."

65310444,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Underdog,American Underdog,"Abstract. American Underdog is a 2021 American biographical sports film about National Football League (NFL) quarterback Kurt Warner. Directed by Andrew and Jon Erwin, the film follows Warner's journey as an undrafted player who ascended to winning Super Bowl XXXIV. It stars Zachary Levi as Warner, alongside Anna Paquin as his wife Brenda and Dennis Quaid as his head coach Dick Vermeil. The film was released theatrically in the United States on December 25, 2021, by Lionsgate. It received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed over $26 million. American Underdog was nominated for the GMA Dove Award for Inspirational Film/Series of the Year at the 2022 GMA Dove Awards. Plot. A young Kurt Warner watches Super Bowl XIX. He then makes a lifelong commitment to becoming a Super Bowl and MVP quarterback. Several years later, Kurt is playing his fifth year for the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) Panthers with coach Terry Allen, and nothing is going Warner's way. Allen threatens to bench him after repeatedly not heeding his coaching, which would effectively end Warner's NFL dream. After a brutal practice following the coach's orders, Kurt continues to be the starter and his numbers climb to where he could have a chance at the Draft. Meanwhile, Kurt becomes interested in a woman he sees dancing at a country bar, so decides to learn how to dance to impress her. Her name is Brenda, is a single mom with two kids and is a nursing student struggling financially. Even though she doesn't think it will work out, Kurt is persistent, walking three miles to her house to get her number. He finds out she was a Marine corporal and that her son is disabled. Kurt instantly bonds with the children, convincing her to be together. With his last season of college football over, Kurt anxiously awaits the draft. He doesn't get picked and wonders why God gave him a dream that he would never obtain. Later, the Green Bay Packers give him the chance to try out, but it goes badly and Kurt goes home dejected. Becoming homeless, he moves into Brenda's basement. He takes a job at a Hy-Vee grocery store, working nights stocking shelves. He discovers success is not found on the football field, but how one acts when confronted with disappointment. Brenda's parents sell the house and move to another state, putting them in a tough situation, and the couple continue to struggle. At one point, their car runs out of gas and Kurt walks several miles in a blizzard to get gas. Kurt gets approached by Jim Foster, who offers him the quarterback position for the Arena Football League 's Iowa Barnstormers. Kurt agrees after discovering no one in the NFL is interested in him. Arena football is different. The field is smaller and the play is much more fast-paced. He loses his first game but wins the next. Kurt and Brenda's relationship is strained from the long commute, and they briefly break up. Brenda's parents are killed in a tornado and she and Kurt decide to get back together. They marry and Kurt finishes the 1996 Arena Football League season with the Iowa Barnstormers in ArenaBowl X, a heartbreaking loss when his completed pass on the last play of the game comes up one yard short of the end zone. Kurt is invited to another tryout for the St. Louis Rams. He doesn't think he will make it; he is having to re-adjust to normal football. Offensive coordinator Mike Martz berates him relentlessly for every mistake. Head Coach, Dick Vermeil, believes in him and tells Kurt he made the team. When starting quarterback Trent Green goes down with an injury in the 1999 NFL preseason, Kurt eventually takes his place. In his first game, Kurt and the Rams face a strong Baltimore Ravens defense led by linebacker Ray Lewis. After a turnover on his first drive, Kurt picks the Ravens' defense apart. With a 27–10 lead, the Rams go into victory formation, and Warner takes a knee to end the game. He immediately gives thanks to God for the opportunity and kisses Brenda in the stands. The Rams post a 13–3 record that season, becoming known as The Greatest Show on Turf due to the high-powered, Warner-led offense. The Rams went on to defeat the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV. During the game, Kurt breaks Joe Montana 's record for throwing the most passing yards in a Super Bowl. Doing so helped him win Super Bowl MVP and be crowned the NFL MVP, making him the first undrafted player to be named either of those in NFL history. The credits show that he would play in two other Super Bowls, Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XLIII. He becomes enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017, and he and Brenda continue to live happily married, with seven children. Cast. Production. A biopic about Kurt Warner was announced in February 2020, when Andrew and Jon Erwin were hired to direct the film, under the title American Underdog: The Kurt Warner Story. In September 2020, it was announced Zachary Levi would star as Warner. In January 2021, Anna Paquin and Dennis Quaid were among the additional cast added to the film. Filming began on January 25, 2021, and concluded on March 6. Shooting occurred in Atlanta and Oklahoma City. The film's title was later shortened to American Underdog, with the release of the film's marketing and the announcement of the Christmas release date. Release. The film was released on December 25, 2021. It was previously scheduled to be released on December 18, 2021, but was delayed from a previous December 10, 2021 date, due to the delayed filming schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on December 15, 2021. Reception. Comparisons to real events. A few events from Warner's actual career were either omitted or different in the film. While the film is correct in showing Kurt Warner's first game as the starting quarterback was the Rams' 1999 season opener against the Ravens, it stayed silent on his brief play late in the Rams' week 17 game of their 1998 season against the 49ers, completing four of his eleven attempts for 39 yards. Warner had technically been part of the Rams longer than Trent Green, though veteran Green was signed in February 1999 to play with the Rams, while arena player Warner had signed with the Rams as a prospect in December 1997 and was dispatched to the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe, rather than kept for the Rams training camp."

75822617,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raikan,Raikan,"Abstract. The raikan (Japanese: 礼冠, Hepburn: raikan, lit. 'ceremonial crown ') is a type of crown worn by Japanese nobility. It was used until the enthronement ceremony of Emperor Kōmei in 1846. In ancient Japan, it was customary to place flowers, branches, and leaves of plants and trees as hair ornaments on the head or to wrap them around the head. These hair ornaments were called uzu (髻華) or kazura (鬘). Later, metal flower ornaments were also called uzu. When Empress Suiko (reigned 593-628) established the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System in 603, gold and silver uzu were placed on cloth crowns (caps) that were color-coded according to rank. In the Nara period (710-794), the ""Taihō Code "" and ""Yōrō Code "" clothing ordinances established the ceremonial dress, court dress, and uniforms to be worn by the crown prince and below. The reikan, together with the ceremonial dress, was the highest ceremonial attire worn at ceremonies such as chōga (朝賀, lit. 'New Year's greetings ') and the enthronement ceremony, but later, when chōga was abolished, it came to be used only for the enthronement ceremony. The raikan was used by the prince and those of the fifth rank and above. The emperor and the crown prince used the benkan, which is also called the raikan in a broader sense. At first, the raikan was only worn by civilian officials, but later the buraikan (武礼冠, lit. 'military ceremonial crown ') was established for military officials. The raikan is composed of an inner crown made of cloth and an outer crown made of metal that surrounds it, with flower stalks standing in a row around it and a halo-like ornament at the back of the crown. The floral arabesque design of the outer crown is thought to be descended from the ancient uzu and kazura, as well as from the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System."

Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is a tactical shooter video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 developed and published by Codemasters. Codemasters has advertised the game as a tactical shooter designed to represent modern infantry combat realistically. It is a stand-alone sequel to Bohemia Interactive's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, but was developed entirely by Codemasters due to a falling-out between the two companies. Plot. Dragon Rising takes place on the fictional island of Skira, in May 2011. After the 2008 Global Economic Crisis causes mass unemployment and political destabilization in China, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) seize control of Skira and the vast, newly discovered reservoir of oil there, from the Russian Federation. Peace talks prove useless as both combatants lay claim to Skira due to previous ownership of it. The situation deteriorates quickly and China begins to fortify its northern provinces in anticipation of armed conflict with Russia. Russia, already countering the PLA on the Chinese mainland, calls to the United States to retake Skira from the Chinese. Bound by treaty arrangements made after the end of the Cold War, America agrees and the two biggest armies in the world begin to clash on the island. Development. Dragon Rising uses a version of Codemasters' EGO Engine, shared with a number of Codemasters' racing games. The engine has been designed to support Dragon Rising's wide, open spaces and 35 km (22 mi) draw distances. The game features both night vision and thermal imaging effects, real-time weather, lighting and shadow effects, 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound support. Other effects include realistic ballistics and limb disattachment. Weapon attachments, a medic system, and swimming are also featured. Reception. The game received ""generally favorable"" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Bit-tech described it as ""a schizophrenic design built over a bland world"" and described the environment as ""an imagination wasteland"". GameSpot said ""This tactical military shooter delivers tense and engaging action, competently completing its objective in the face of AI blunders and occasional bugs."" However, GameSpot did note the generally intelligent AI enemies and allies alike, saying that the squadmates are ""more of an asset than a liability"", and that the enemies make you ""feel threatened,"" and are like ""battle-hardened, intelligent soldiers."" IGN described the game as unique, fun, and challenging, but unpolished. Despite ""consistent issues due to weak AI,"" they said the AI was decent, and ""not awful."" Praise was also given to the details and graphics of the PC version. However, some reviewers found that the game ""lacked polish,"" and that despite many finding that they ""wanted to like it,"" it simply did not live up to expectations. IGN stated that the game should not have been released on consoles as it feels and plays like a PC-only experience. Sequel. The sequel, Operation Flashpoint: Red River was released for the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC."

Street Road dates back to colonial times, when a straight road in Marlborough Township was laid out by William Penn and was named Marlborough Street, running from Pennsbury Township to the Marlborough Friends Meetinghouse. In 1815, a road was surveyed between Market Street in Philadelphia and McCalls Ferry on the Susquehanna River to facilitate the westward expansion of settlers. This new road followed the alignment of Marlborough Street. This road became known as Street Road, named after Marlborough Street that it followed. When Pennsylvania first legislated its routes in 1911, Street Road was not given a route number. By 1928, Street Road existed as a paved road between London Grove and Red Lion and from US 122/PA 29 (now US 202/US 322) in Thornbury to PA 352 in Tanguy. PA 129 was designated along the portion of road between US 122/PA 29 and PA 352. PA 926 was first designated by 1928 to run from US 122/PA 29 east to PA 129 along unpaved Oakbourne Road and paved Concord Road and Westbourne Road. By 1930, PA 926 was realigned to follow Street Road between US 122 and PA 352, replacing the PA 129 designation on this stretch which was shifted to a road further south. In 1937, PA 926 was extended along Street Road to its current length between US 122 (now PA 10) near Russellville and PA 3 near Westtown. By 1940, the entire route was paved. PA 926 has remained along the same alignment since. On January 22, 2024, construction will begin on a roundabout at the PA 41 intersection in Londonderry Township. The roundabout is planned to cost $6.3 million and be completed in the later part of 2024. PA 926 Alternate Truck. Pennsylvania Route 926 Alternate Truck was a truck route bypassing a weight-restricted bridge over Radley Run in Thornbury Township, on which trucks over 36 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. Formed in 2013, it followed PA 52, US 1, and US 202/US 322. In 2020, the bridge was reconstructed, and the route was decommissioned."

Located adjacent to Beit Shemesh, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Yehuda Regional Council. In 2021 it had a population of 539. Modern history. The village was established in 1950 by immigrants from Yemen, and was initially named Dayraban Gimel after the nearby depopulated Palestinian village of Dayr Aban. In the following years the founders left and were replaced by immigrants from Morocco. Education. The Beit Shemesh Yeshiva is located in Zanoah. Most of the students are from Ramat Beit Shemesh Alef. Aside from Talmud study, the curriculum includes English language and mathematics, and unlike many such institutions in Israel today, students study for the Bagrut matriculation exams. From 2004 to 2015, when it closed, Zanoah was also the home of Yeshivat Yesodei HaTorah, which offered a gap year program for international English-speaking students. History of archaeological site. The old site lies on a hill, adjacent to the watercourse Nahal Zanoah, a stream that runs north and drains into Nahal Sorek. Although listed in Joshua 15:34 as being a city in the plain, it is actually partly in the hill country, partly in the plain. The ruins of Khurbet Zanuʻ which lie on a high hill south of the moshav are thought to be the ancient village of Zanoah, mentioned in Egyptian letters, later part of the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:34), and in the ""Second Temple period... reinhabited,"" as recorded in the Bible (Nehemiah 3:13). During the 1st-century CE, the village was known by the name Zenoha. An overhead power line now runs through the ancient site. The site reeks with antiquity, with the signs of an old settlement everywhere. The area of the old settlement is extensive, with razed structures that once stood as walls and houses. Shards of broken pottery are strewn extensively throughout the grounds, with several open-mouthed cisterns and antres. Zanoah is mentioned in the Book of Nehemiah as one of the towns resettled by the Jewish exiles returning from the Babylonian captivity and who helped to construct the walls of Jerusalem during the reign of the Persian king, Artaxerxes I (Xerxes). Nehemiah further records that those returnees were the very descendants of the people who had formerly resided in the town before their banishment from the country, who had all returned to live in their former places of residence. Whether the reference there refers to the Zanoah in the Shefelah (Joshua 15:34) or to the Zanoah in the Judaean mountains (now known as Khirbet Zanuta) is now unclear, as there were two places by the same name. Based on the archaeological evidence, Zanoah in the Shefelah was a settled village during the Persian period. According to the Mishnah, compiled in the 2nd-century CE (Munich MS., Menahot 83b), the finest of the wheat used to grow in the valley adjacent to Zanoah, from whence it was taken for the Omer offering in the Temple. Eusebius (3rd–4th century CE) mentions Zanoah in his Onomasticon as a village ""within the borders of Eleutheropolis (Beit Gubrin) on the way to Ailia (Jerusalem),"" and which was still inhabited in his day. C.R. Conder and H.H. Kitchener described the ruins of Khurbet Zanûa, visited by them in 1881. An archaeological survey of the site was conducted in 2008 by Pablo Betzer on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA). The site has never been excavated."

Municipal elections were held in Rome on 21 November and 5 December 1993 to elect the Mayor of Rome and 60 members of the City Council. For the first time under a new local electoral law, enacted on 25 March 1993, citizens could vote to directly elect the Mayor. As no candidate won a majority in the first round, a runoff was held between the top two candidates – Francesco Rutelli, a former radical deputy at that time one of the most prominent figure of the environmentalist Federation of the Greens (FdV) and Gianfranco Fini, Giorgio Almirante 's pupil and national leader of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) – which Rutelli finally won. Background. With the Law of 25 March 1993, n. 81 was introduced the direct election of Mayor. In this way the form of government of the city, previously attributed to a parliamentary model, was neared at semi-presidential system. The same law fixed four years term of office for Mayor, later extended to five years. The first direct-election of the Mayor of Rome took place in a period of changes for the Italian politics: the scandal called Tangentopoli, which highlighted pervasive corruption in the Italian political system, exposed in the 1992 Mani Pulite investigations, led to the collapse of the dominant Christian Democracy party and of its allies in the municipal politics. Voting System. The voting system is used for all mayoral elections in Italy, in the city with a population higher than 15,000 inhabitants. Under this system voters express a direct choice for the mayor or an indirect choice voting for the party of the candidate's coalition. If no candidate receives 50% of votes, the top two candidates go to a second round after two weeks. This gives a result whereby the winning candidate may be able to claim majority support, although it is not guaranteed. The election of the City Council is based on a direct choice for the candidate with a preference vote: the candidate with the majority of the preferences is elected. The number of the seats for each party is determined proportionally. Parties and candidates. This is a list of the major parties (and their respective leaders) which participated in the election."
15089261,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_plants_poisonous_to_equines,List of plants poisonous to equines,"Abstract. Many plants are poisonous to equines; the species vary depending on location, climate, and grazing conditions. In many cases, entire genera are poisonous to equines and include many species spread over several continents. Plants can cause reactions ranging from laminitis (found in horses bedded on shavings from black walnut trees), anemia, kidney disease and kidney failure (from eating the wilted leaves of red maples), to cyanide poisoning (from the ingestion of plant matter from members of the genus Prunus) and other symptoms. Members of genus Prunus have also been theorized to be at fault for mare reproductive loss syndrome. Some plants, including yews, are deadly and extremely fast-acting. Several plants, including nightshade, become more toxic as they wilt and die, posing a danger to horses eating dried hay or plant matter blown into their pastures. The risk of animals becoming ill during the fall is increased, as many plants slow their growth in preparation for winter, and equines begin to browse on the remaining plants. Many toxic plants are unpalatable, so animals avoid them where possible. However, this is not always the case; locoweeds, for example, are addictive and once a horse has eaten them, it will continue to eat them whenever possible, and can never be exposed to them again. When a toxic plant is ingested, it can be difficult to diagnose, because exposure over time can cause symptoms to occur after the animal is no longer exposed to the plant. Toxins are often metabolized before the symptoms become obvious, making it hard or impossible to test for them. Hungry or thirsty horses are more likely to eat poisonous plants, as are those pastured on overgrazed lands. Animals with mineral deficiencies due to poor diets will sometimes seek out poisonous plants. Poisonous plants are more of a danger to livestock after wildfires, as they often regrow more quickly."

Jennifer Hermoso Fuentes (born 9 May 1990), known as Jenni Hermoso, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for Liga MX Femenil club Tigres UANL and for the Spain women's national team. She is the all-time top scorer for Spain, and was part of her country's championship side at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, where she was also awarded the Silver Ball. Hermoso developed through the youth teams of her hometown club Atlético Madrid, where she stayed for eight years before continuing on to Rayo Vallecano. Hermoso won her first senior title with Rayo in 2011, and in 2013, made her first international move to Tyresö FF in Sweden. Months later, she competed in the UEFA Women's Euro 2013 with Spain, scoring her first competitive international goal in a group stage win against England. Hermoso moved to FC Barcelona in 2014, where she advanced her position from attacking midfielder to false 9. Her positional change turned her to a prolific goalscorer, as she earned two Pichichi titles as the Spanish league's top scorer as well as two league titles and two Copas de la Reina. She also competed with Spain at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Spain's first ever participation in the tournament. After exiting Barcelona in 2017, Hermoso went abroad to PSG and then returned to Spain in the 2018–19 season to play for the club where she developed, Atlético Madrid. She won her third Pichichi title and fourth league title there. Hermoso rejoined FC Barcelona in 2019 following Spain's exit from the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup tournament, where she finished as Spain's top scorer. In her final three seasons at Barcelona, she won three league titles, three Copas de la Reina, and the 2020–21 UEFA Women's Champions League, alongside the continental treble that same season. Individually, she finished both the 2019–20 and 2020–21 league seasons as the Primera División's top scorer, in 2020 and 2021 she finished as the top scorer in Europe's top five women's leagues, and in 2021, was the joint-top scorer in that season's UEFA Women's Champions League. At the end of 2021, she finished second in Ballon d'Or voting and was the world's highest female goalscorer of the calendar year with 51 goals. Following Barcelona's second-place finish in the 2021–22 UEFA Women's Champions League, Hermoso signed for Pachuca in Mexico's Liga MX Femenil. In 2023, Hermoso participated in her third World Cup with Spain, which they won for the first time in their history. During the medal ceremony, Hermoso was kissed by then-RFEF president Luis Rubiales in an event that would later be called the Rubiales affair. The kiss itself and Rubiales' response to the criticism against him sparked intense international backlash, the eventual removal of Rubiales and Spain head coach Jorge Vilda from the federation, and the ongoing promise of an immediate restructuring of the entirety of Spanish football. Hermoso holds the record for the most all-time Pichichi trophies with five. Hermoso also holds the record of the top all-time goalscorer for Spain, achieving this milestone in 2021. Early life. Hermoso grew up playing futsal and seven-a-side football, sharing teams with boys throughout most of her youth. Hermoso is the granddaughter of Antonio Hernández, a former goalkeeper for Atlético Madrid. As a child, he would take her to watch Atlético's matches at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. Hermoso began playing at Atlético Madrid at twelve years old with encouragement from her grandfather. Club career. International career. Style of play. In the beginnings of Hermoso's career, she was positioned as either a center midfielder or attacking midfielder. In 2015, under the instruction of Xavi Llorens and Jorge Vilda, Hermoso took up a more offensive role as a center-forward or false 9, which she still plays today. This change allowed her to shift her game from giving assists and creating chances to becoming a prolific goalscorer. As a false 9, Hermoso is at her most productive as a forward when she is given the opportunity to play deeper and roam freely between opposing lines. She regularly switches between her position in the center and either position on the wings, both creating and finding space. Hermoso's free-roaming positional play is key to Barcelona 's tactical setup, for it allows her space to receive the ball and create chances. Aside from being their top goalscorer, she has been one of Barcelona's biggest contributors to the team's attack during her two separate stints at the club. With Spain, she has a slightly different tactical role that requires a more intense press and more positional discipline. Physically, Hermoso is known for her comparatively tall stature of 1.75m (5 ft. 9 in.), which aids in her ability to head in goals and makes her a threat on set pieces. As she is not particularly pacey, she excels when given the opportunity to play slower, possession-based football. She is left footed, but is capable of scoring with either foot. Hermoso is also keen on scoring goals from outside the box. Patrice Lair, PSG 's former manager, defined her as ""a very technical and athletic left-footed player. She will be complementary to our attack and she can also play in the midfielder position. We need scorers who can score a lot and this is precisely her profile.""

9592210,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyingbolt,Flyingbolt,"Abstract. Flyingbolt (1959 - 1983) was a famous racehorse. Officially he is the second best steeplechaser of all time, behind only Arkle, who was ironically stabled just a few doors away in the same yard at Kilsallaghan, Co. Dublin where both were trained by Tom Dreaper. A comparison of their merits is probably best illustrated by the Official Handicapper, who at the end of the 1965-1966 season rated Arkle the superior by only 1 lb (0.5 kg). Timeform, the highly respected racing publication, had a difference of 2 lbs between them. However, whereas Arkle is feted and remembered as the greatest steeplechaser of all time, Flyingbolt has been all but forgotten. As a hurdler, he was the best Tom Dreaper ever trained. His wins included the Gloucestershire Hurdle at Cheltenham (now the Supreme Novices' Hurdle) and the Scalp Hurdle at Leopardstown (now the Irish Champion Hurdle). He also finished third in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. Flyingbolt and Arkle never met on the race track, mainly because they were trained by the same man, and he preferred to keep them apart. Background. Flyingbolt was born in 1959 in unusual circumstances. His sire Airborne, the 1946 Derby winner, had become almost totally impotent by 1958 having only managed to get 3 mares in foal in each of his previous 2 seasons at stud. As a result, he was of little interest to breeders, so local man Robert Way gave him a home on his small stud farm where he housed a few mares of his own. Aware of his near non-existent reproductive history in recent years, Way put him into a paddock as a companion for the 19-year-old mare Eastlock, which he had purchased for 50 guineas at a dispersal sale in 1941. Eastlock, who was unraced, delivered 10 foals in 11 years for her new owner, including 5 minor winners, but having failed to conceive in 1955, 1956 and 1957, she was retired from breeding. However, her natural-born union with Airborne in 1958 resulted in the birth of a chestnut colt foal the following spring when she was 20 years of age. There was little to recommend the newborn in terms of his pedigree, with his sire being deemed a failure at stud and none of his immediate female line having ever set foot on a racecourse. Way sold him as a foal at the Newmarket December Sales for 210 guineas to Larry Ryan from Co. Clare in Ireland. After winning in the show ring as a yearling, he was offered for sale that autumn at the Ballsbridge sales in Dublin through the Rathmore Stud owned by six-time Irish champion jockey Martin Molony, and was bought by George Ponsonby for 490 guineas. Ponsonby had already purchased a number of horses which went into training with Tom Dreaper. This one did likewise and was passed on to Mrs. Jean Wilkinson, who combined the names of his sire (Airborne) and dam (Eastlock) to give him the name Flyingbolt. Racing career. Assessment. In the end, Arkle and Flyingbolt never met on the racecourse but they did so at home as Pat Taaffe recounted in his book My Life & Arkle' s. Flyingbolt was hacking along with Paddy Woods on his back and a funny look in his eye. Upsides on Arkle, I was thinking to myself that I would never see a prouder horse than this. Then he turned his head and slowly looked us over. You could almost see the curl of the lip. This was the 'Who are these peasants?' look of his that I was to come to know so well and I suppose I should have been forewarned. Next thing I knew he's taken a strong hold and was away. Not to be outdone, Arkle took an equally strong hold and got up alongside. And so these two young chasers who were then potentially the best in the world staged their own private race during what was supposed to be a normal session of morning schooling. They took the next four fences, neck and neck, flat out as though their lives depended on the outcome, while Paddy and I held on to them for dear life and waited for the fires to die down. Well, they cleared them all right, but it was a bit too close for comfort and Mr. Dreaper never allowed them to be schooled together again. In character, they were the night and the day. A small child could walk into Arkle's box in absolute safety. No child, no man would ever willingly step into Flyingbolt's.... at least, not twice. He'd kick the eye out of your head. He had a competitive spirit every bit the equal of Arkle's and be it over jumps or on the flat he was a superb machine and a brave one.... For him, the future was limitless. There were no mountains too high for this one to climb, not even Arkle's.... Certainly he was as good at seven as Arkle was at the same age.... If progress had been maintained, he would have been as good, if not better, than Arkle himself....And if illness hadn't ruined his career, Flyingbolt would have dominated chasing. Jim Dreaper, Tom's son, was a schoolboy at the time and he recounted his thoughts on both Arkle and Flyingbolt to Hugh McIlvanney 30 years later. ""It is foolish to say there can never be another steeplechaser as great as Arkle. There may have been one in the yard along with him. It is impossible to tell how fantastic Flyingbolt might have been if he had not contracted brucellosis."" In an interview with Donn McClean on the Irish Field Podcast, “Leading The Field” in February 2024, Jim Dreaper revealed that “The Handicapper told my father he could not bring himself to call Flyingbolt the equal of Arkle, he had him one pound below him, but he said that in all honesty he could not split them. And Pat Taaffe said that if it was a 3-mile race on heavy ground he wasn’t sure which he would have ridden, by which I think he meant he would probably have chosen Flyingbolt.” Tom Taaffe, son of Pat, and a Gold Cup winning trainer himself, remembers: ""Daddy always maintained that there was nothing between the two of them. He might have liked Arkle more as a character, and he won three Gold Cups, but there was nothing between them."" This would seem to tie in with the comment attributed to Pat in Ivor Herbert’s aforementioned book: “I suppose that one day Arkle and Flyingbolt will have to meet. It’ll be a terrible day for me. I couldn’t ride both and one would have to be beaten.” Timeform said of Flyingbolt ""he was almost as good as Arkle at his best"" and cite his 1966 victory in the Irish Grand National over Height O'Fashion conceding 40lbs as being good enough to be in the same league as Arkle. In Timeform's list, Flyingbolt is rated 210 compared to Arkle on 212. Next is Sprinter Sacre on 192 with Kauto Star and Mill House on 191. Brian O'Connor, the Irish Times racing correspondent and author of the 2011 book, Ireland's Greatest Racehorses, wrote of Flyingbolt: ""It's hardly fair that such an immense talent is mostly reduced to a mere footnote in the Arkle story. Whatever you think about Timeform, there are still those around from that golden era who insist that Flyingbolt was Arkle's superior."" Sports broadcaster, commentator and journalist, Hugh Cahill, interviewed trainer, former jockey and racing pundit Ted Walsh about Flyingbolt for his 2018 book ""WINNERS"" and Walsh had this to say about him: I would say that Flyingbolt was the best horse I ever saw. Arkle was super and a great horse, he rewrote the history books in terms of handicaps and all of that, but Flyingbolt did everything Arkle did and he did it better. He would carry the big weights and destroy horses. He beat two very good mares - Height O'Fashion and Flying Wild - giving them, not pounds but stones, forty-two pounds in weight, which is three stone. It was unheard of. Twelve-stone-seven he was carrying, and he was sailing away from them. In 1964, Arkle had beaten Height O'Fashion in the Irish National giving her thirty pounds but this fella gave her forty, and beat her more easily. He was a big chestnut horse but he was always in the shadow of Arkle because Arkle was 'The Man' and everyone thought he was unbeatable. It's a bit like a brilliant golfer being in the shadow of Tiger Woods. At that time, there were no conditions races, you had to run in handicaps when you went out of your novice races. In the sixties and seventies there were four big handicap races in Ireland: the Troytown at Navan, the Thyestes at Gowran Park, the Leopardstown Chase and the Irish National at Fairyhouse. Flyingbolt ran in the 1966 Thyestes and he won it in a canter. He won what we now call the Supreme Novices, then he won the Arkle Challenge in 1965. He was an aeroplane. Tom then sent him to the two-mile Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham and he bolted in. The very next day, he ran in the Champion Hurdle and finished third. If it was the other way around, he would have won both of them. He jumped the hurdles too big in the Hurdle, having run in the Chase the day before. He came back after that and the next time he ran was in the 1966 Irish National at Fairyhouse three weeks later, with twelve-stone-seven on his back over three miles two, and he beat Height O'Fashion. It was unbelievable. I remember thinking at that time there is no way he would beat her giving her three stone. Three stone! But he beat her again. At that time, they rated him one pound behind Arkle, because Arkle was a legend and they obviously couldn't put something above him in the ratings until the horses met - but they never did. I think if they both lined up, Flyingbolt would have won. For a period in his life, he was the best horse I'd ever seen. He achieved such great things as a National Hunt horse. To this day, when people ask me which was the best horse I ever saw run, I tell them that I saw Arkle and I saw Flyingbolt - and that Flyingbolt was the best. In an interview with the Racing Post in November 2020, Walsh further expressed his thoughts on the Arkle/Flyingbolt debate. ""Flyingbolt was the greatest National Hunt horse I ever saw. I've never seen a horse since or before who would have beaten him. He never took on Arkle because they were in the same yard, but I have no doubt he would have ‘eaten’ Arkle."" Horse racing journalist and author, Brough Scott, paid tribute to him in his 2008 book, Of Horses and Heroes, when he said: ""More than 40 years on since he first blazed over Cheltenham's fences, it is time we paid Flyingbolt his due as one of the very greatest of them all."" In an article in the Racing Post in March 2009, John Randall wrote, ""In any era except that of Arkle, Flyingbolt would have reigned supreme, but he raced in the shadow of his stablemate and never received the credit he deserved. He was officially rated only one pound below Arkle, and although it defies belief that the two greatest steeplechasers of all time should have been in the same stable at the same time, with the same jockey and even the same groom (Johnny Lumley), the figures speak for themselves."" In a more recent Racing Post article (January 2023), Randall reflected on the achievements of both Arkle and Flyingbolt in comparison to their latter day contemporaries: ""The modern jumps scene would be almost unrecognisable to a time-travelling racegoer from the 1960's who saw the two greatest steeplechasers of all time, stablemates Arkle and Flyingbolt. Some have questioned the validity of the Dreaper pair's sky-high ratings but the reason for them is simple: they were forced to demonstrate the full extent of their greatness by conceding up to three stone (42lbs) in handicaps to rivals who were of normal Gold Cup standard. Modern champions do not run in handicaps, and are therefore not tested to that extent."" In comparing the two, he noted that ""Arkle became a folk hero, celebrated in song, poetry, drama and legend, so it is hard to believe he had a stablemate who was his equal - but a strict assessment, crucially forged in handicaps, suggests that may have been true."" When the Racing Post conducted a readers' poll in 2004 to determine the 100 favourite racehorses of all time, Arkle, predictably, was number one whilst Flyingbolt didn't even make the list, lending credence to Randall's assertion that Flyingbolt was indeed ""racing's greatest unsung hero."" Retirement. Flyingbolt was retired in 1971 and spent much of his time in the company of former stablemate Fort Leney, a winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 1968. Flyingbolt died in 1983 at the age of 24."

4391631,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_Monkey,Sock Monkey,"Abstract. Sock Monkey is a series of comics and illustrated books written and drawn by the American cartoonist Tony Millionaire. Description. Sock Monkey relates the adventures of the titular sock monkey, named Uncle Gabby, and a plush crow named Mr. Crow. Despite being toys, they are able to move, think, talk, and eat, as are most of the other toys in the series. The books are notable for their intricate artwork, dark humor, and quaint, vaulted dialogue. The inspiration for books' detailed settings come from Millionaire's childhood memories of his grandparents' Victorian house. In contrast to the scabrous humor of his weekly comic strip Maakies, Millionaire has said that ""Sock Monkey is me trying to rise above all that bullshit, to be more poetic, looking at the bright side, remembering the things that used to delight me as a child."" At the same time, ""the main theme to all the Sock Monkey books is the crashing of innocent fantasy into bone-crushing reality."" Books. Four volumes of black-and-white Sock Monkey comics have been published; each volume consists of two issues. Volume 3 won the 2001 Eisner Award for Best Humor Publication. Volume 4 featured one issue drawn in charcoal, as opposed to the ink of the other issues, and another issue in which the character designs were changed dramatically. These comics have also been collected in two trade paperbacks, each containing two volumes: The Adventures of Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey (2000) and The Collected Works of Tony Millionaire's Sock Monkey (2004). As of late 2006 a four-issue Sock Monkey miniseries featuring an extended story titled ""The Inches Incident"" is being released one issue at a time. In addition to the Sock Monkey comics, Millionaire has also produced five other Sock Monkey books. Sock Monkey: A Children's Book (2001) and Sock Monkey: The Glass Doorknob (2002) mix comics with illustrated prose. Sock Monkey: Uncle Gabby (2004), That Darn Yarn (2005), and Little and Large (2005) are full-color, hardcover comic books. That Darn Yarn and Little and Large are both 36 pages and read much more like children's storybooks than Millionaire's other Sock Monkey comics. The 8 issues (""Heaven"", ""Borneo"", ""Dollhouse"", ""The Trumbernick"", ""The Hunters"", ""A Baby Bird"", ""The Oceanic Society"", and ""Heartbreak""), ""The Inches Incident"", Sock Monkey: The Glass Doorknob, and Sock Monkey: Uncle Gabby have been published together by Fantagraphics Books, Inc. in a volume known as Sock Monkey Treasury (2014). Millionaire also published an 80-page illustrated story with co-author Matt Danner under Fantagraphics Books, Inc. called Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods (2014). This book re-tells the story of Uncle Gabby's origins (previously seen in Sock Monkey: A Children's Book), along with an adventure shared by Uncle Gabby, Mr. Crow, and Inches.Sock Monkey: A Children's Book and Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods are both illustrated literature, as opposed to Millionaire's usual comics. While Sock Monkey: A Children's Book alternates between a page of text and illustration, Sock Monkey Into The Deep Woods has small illustrations interspersed throughout the prose. All the Sock Monkey books are published by Dark Horse Comics. Dark Horse also sells a variety of Sock Monkey merchandise including stationery, t-shirts and figurines. Audience. Though the titles, format, and general ambience of the Sock Monkey books are strongly reminiscent of classic children's literature and picture books, Millionaire has emphasized that ""some of the Sock Monkey books I do are for kids, and some are definitely not."" He describes them as being ""based on kids' books. They're for adults who remember and love great old kids' books."" Recurring characters. Uncle Gabby: A sock monkey with a hat and a penchant for poetry. He is curious and eager to help others. Together with his friend Mr. Crow he cooks up various schemes, such as going on a salamander hunt or match-making for a widowed mouse, which tend to lead to unforeseen calamity. He is loosely connected to the character of the same name in Maakies. Mr. Crow: A plush crow with buttons for eyes. He has a fondness for alcohol, and is generally more brash and excitable than Uncle Gabby. Unaware that he is not a real bird, he occasionally attempts (and fails) to fly, and does not understand why other crows are not friendly toward him. Though ostensibly an alternate version of Drinky Crow from Maakies, in the Sock Monkey stories he is referred to as ""Mr. Crow"" or simply ""Crow,"" never ""Drinky."" Ann-Louise: The young girl whose home is the starting point of most of the stories (although the house itself is drawn differently each time). She owns Uncle Gabby, whom she treats very dearly, as well as most of the other toys. It is unclear whether or not she owns Mr. Crow; in the first issue he is depicted as living in the house next door, but in others he seems to live with Ann-Louise. Inches: A small doll with an egotistic, inconsiderate, and bellicose personality. Adaptation. In 2014, Millionaire and animator Matt Danner created an proof-of-concept short to promote an upcoming live-action/animated feature. The film, to be written and directed by Danner, would be based on the storybook Sock Monkey Into the Deep Woods. As of April 2017, they were shopping around Hollywood to find investors interested in the film."

Even descriptions of the youth's behaviour make it beautiful. The youth's beauty covers the blots of vice, but everything eventually loses its qualities if it is misused. Structure. Sonnet 95 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 11th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: The 8th line has both an initial and a mid-line reversal: Initial reversals are also present in lines 6 and 10, and potentially in lines 2, 4, and 9.

Adam Seybert (May 16, 1773 – May 2, 1825) was an American politician who served as a Democratic-Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district from 1809 to 1815 and 1817 to 1819. He was a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania and a mineralogist who organized the first mineralogy collection in the United States in the 1790s. Early life and education. Seybert was born on May 16, 1773, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1793 with a degree in medicine from the University of Pennsylvania. He continued his studies in Europe, and attended schools in Edinburgh, Göttingen, and Paris. He studied mineralogy at the Ecole des Mines and was the first American to study mineralogy in Germany. He returned to Philadelphia with a collection of minerals and worked as a physician for a short time before establishing himself as a ""druggist, chemist and apothecary"". He was a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. He was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1797, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1824. Political career. In 1809, Seybert was elected to the 11th United States Congress as a Democratic-Republican representative for Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Benjamin Say. He was reelected to the Twelfth and Thirteenth Congresses. He was chairman of the United States House Committee on Revisal and Unfinished Business during the Twelfth Congress. He was again elected to the Fifteenth Congress and served from 1817 to 1819. He visited Europe from 1819 to 1821 and again in 1824 and settled in Paris, France, where he died May 2, 1825. He was originally interred at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and re-interred to Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia. Mineralogy. Seybert established the first mineralogy collection in the United States in the 1790s. The collection contained over 1,725 crystals and rocks. The noted mineralogist, Benjamin Silliman, was known to have traveled to Philadelphia to view the collection, and have Seybert analyze minerals from Silliman's collection. In 1812, Seybert sold his mineralogy collection to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. His political career took priority over his interest in mineralogy, and when Parker Cleaveland wrote to him in December of 1813 with questions on mineralogy, he replied that he had lost interest in the science. Legacy. After Seyberts' death, his mineralogy collection was put on display at the Free Natural History Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. The University of Pennsylvania philosophy department named a chair in the department the Adam Seybert Professor in Moral and Intellectual Philosophy. The chair was funded by Adam's son, Henry Seybert. The duties of the chair included hosting the Adam Seybert committee which investigated the possibility of the spirit world. The committee met from 1883 to 1887 but was unable to discover any evidence and subsequent holders of the chair were freed from continuing the investigations. Publications."

Rowland Palace is a novelist married to a distant cousin, Brynhild, a ""Quiet Lovely"" who is twelve years younger than he. Inordinately sensitive to criticism, Palace has been withdrawing from a wife who is becoming critical of him. When he decides he needs to engage a publicist to cultivate his neglected public image, he hides his plan. The publicist he chooses, Immanuel Cloote, proves to be an agent with imagination and ""manifest gusto."" Meanwhile, Brynhild meets and becomes the unique confidant of Alfred Bunter, a rising young novelist of whose popular success Palace is jealous. Bunter confides to Brynhild that he is really David Lewis, from Cardiff, who has left his wife and assumed a new identity as an author. Scarcely has he confided in Brynhild, however, than his true identity is exposed by someone who turns out to be Mr. Cloote, intent on sabotaging Rowland Palace's literary competitors. The plight of Bunter/Lewis elicits Brynhild's sympathies. Brynhild, who had been feeling that she was ""too aloof for life,"" gains a new sense of confidence and self-assurance from her brief affair, and the novel closes with the news that she is with child.

Haydentown is an unincorporated village which is located on Route 857 in Fayette County, Pennsylvania in the United States. History. John Hayden came to Fayette County, Pennsylvania in 1778, after serving for six months in the Revolutionary War. Being a blacksmith by trade, he soon discovered stone coal (hard coal) and the best of iron ore. There were a few Scotch settled just west of the trading post called Hardbargain. This settlement became known as Georgetown. Sometime around this same time, several Germans organized the settlement of Berlin. Georgetown then became known as Haydenberg, and was patented by John Hayden in 1787. The town subsequently was renamed as Haydentown. Roughly two years later, Hayden dug out what he believed to be limestone from a creek bed of a tributary of the Georges River in Georges Township. Unable to burn the limestone, he took a portion of it to the blacksmith shop, and discovered that it was high quality iron ore. Hayden subsequently was appointed as a captain of a militia company that was raised in the three settlements of Berlin, Georgetown and Hardbargain to drive Indigenous people of the region north and west. For his actions, he was allotted 9,000 acres of land. Because all related land records were destroyed in the War of 1812, and because the United States Congress never passed legislation giving Hayden the right to dispose of his land, only a tract that he donated for the Hayden Cemetery was subsequently honored. That cemetery is now known as the White Rock Cemetery. Legacy. By 1910, more iron ore was produced in Haydentown than in the city of Pittsburgh."

Torresdale, also formerly known as Torrisdale, is a neighborhood in the Far Northeast section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Torresdale is located along the Delaware River between Holmesburg and Bensalem Township in neighboring Bucks County. The adjacent confluence of the Poquessing Creek with the Delaware River had been favored by William Penn 's surveyor, Thomas Holme, as the site for the city that Penn planned to found. Although a more southerly site was finally selected, Holme and others acquired property there, where he is buried. History. Torresdale, originally Torrisdale, was named by Charles Macalester for his family's ancestral Scotland home. Before the Act of Consolidation, 1854, Torresdale had been part of Delaware Township of Philadelphia County, and before 1853, part of Lower Dublin Township of the same county. In 1894, Torresdale was the site of the regatta of the Rowing Association of American Colleges. Long before the existence of what is referred to today as the Philadelphia Main Line, Torresdale, along with Holmesburg to its south and Andalusia to its north, had been Philadelphia's posh suburban neighborhood, as evidenced by Glen Foerd on the Delaware, a luxurious riverside estate and Andalusia, the Biddle estate, for which the village of Andalusia is named. Notable sites. Torresdale is the site of Holy Family University and Nazareth Academy High School. The Union League Golf Club at Torresdale, a Donald Ross –designed golf course, located at Frankford and Grant Avenues, is one of the finest golf courses in the Philadelphia region.

Fort Bliss National Cemetery is a United States National Cemetery in West Texas, located at Fort Bliss, a U.S. Army post adjacent to the city of El Paso. Administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, it encompasses 82.1 acres (33.2 ha), and as of 2014, had over 50,000 interments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. History. Fort Bliss itself was not established until the 1840s, but burials were made in the area of the cemetery as early as 1833. The fort was used as a Confederate infantry post during the Civil War, a cavalry post for training during World War I, and then became a demobilization camp after the war. Before Ft. Bliss was moved, soldiers were buried at what is now Cleveland Square and the downtown El Paso Public Library. Union soldiers buried there were removed and reburied at Fort Snelling in 1883. In 1893, this former Ft. Bliss cemetery was granted to the City of El Paso. In 1894, the area where the cemetery is currently located was designated as the Fort Bliss Post Cemetery. In 1914, the cemetery measured just 2.2 acres (0.89 ha); an additional 2.2 acres were added during the war. In 1939, funds were allocated for improvements and plans were approved to designate it a national cemetery. In addition to being the final resting place of American soldiers, Fort Bliss National Cemetery was chosen by the Chinese government as the place of interment for 52 Republic of China Air Force cadets who died while training at the fort in 1944. Several German prisoners of war, and three Japanese civilians who were transferred from a cemetery in Lordsburg, New Mexico were also interred here, as were a German scientist who died while participating in research projects at Fort Bliss during World War II and an officer of the British Royal Air Force who served during that same war. In order to make way for new construction in the central business district in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1955, the remains of the Fort's namesake Lieutenant Colonel William Wallace Smith Bliss (1815–1853) were disinterred from Girod Street Cemetery in New Orleans and brought to Fort Bliss, along with the monument erected in his memory. In June 1973, the Veterans Administration took over operational duties of the cemetery. During the 1990s, twenty acres were added to the cemetery which were given by the Department of the Army. In 2002, the cemetery was using 90 million gallons of water a year to keep the grass in the area green. Plans for xeriscaping the cemetery began discussion in 2002. The xeriscaping was opposed by many because it was felt that xeriscaping looked less dignified or respectful, according to the El Paso Times. In 2007, the cemetery was xeriscaped with a budget of $4.2 million to convert the land. William F. Tuerk, director of the National Cemetery Administration oversaw the change. In 2013, the cemetery won the Texas Environmental Excellence Award because it was saving an average of $400,000 a year because of cutting costs for water and grass upkeep. In 2013, around 100 graves began to sink in the cemetery due to heavy rainfall in the area. Eventually, 1,300 graves were damaged, prompting geologists, Diane Doser and Lixin Jin and Representative Joe Moody to investigate the cause of the problem at the cemetery. Notable monuments.

The Buesaco-Aranda Fault (Spanish: Falla Buesaco-Aranda) is a dextral strike-slip fault in the department of Nariño in southwestern Colombia. The fault has a total length of 29 kilometres (18 mi) and runs along an average northeast to southwest strike in the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The 1995 Pasto earthquake is associated with the active fault showing high amounts of displacement. The earthquake caused seven fatalities. Etymology. The fault is named after Buesaco and Aranda, a vereda of Pasto. Other sources call the fault by the general name of Silvia-Pijao Fault. Description. The Buesaco-Aranda Fault, extends in a north-northeast to northeast direction from near the Galeras Volcano in southwestern Colombia. The Buesaco Fault is located 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to the west of the Aranda Fault. On the eastern block of the Buesaco Fault, the basement rock consists of basic volcanic, andesite and dark sedimentary rocks which probably developed in a marginal basin environment during Early Cretaceous time. On the western block of the fault are a group of low-grade metamorphic rocks which consist of greenschist, amphibolite, quartzite and black schist, all of Paleozoic age. The area is mostly covered by a Pliocene blanket of pyroclastic rocks and calc-alkaline lavas, Quaternary lahar deposits and fluvio -glacial deposits. The Buesaco-Aranda Fault has a very well-defined fault trace, with strongly deformed landforms of Pleistocene-Holocene age, clear breaks in slope along eroded fault scarps, and fault scarps facing both to the southeast or the northwest, which is a characteristic of strike-slip faults. Systematic right lateral deflections of some stream gullies, river channels, and ridges are visible. Offset features in confined alluvial deposits and in recent alluvial fans have fresh scarp morphology. The net cumulative horizontal slip calculated is 188 ± 14 metres (617 ± 46 ft), with 160 ± 10 metres (525 ± 33 ft) of displacement in offset landforms along the Aranda Fault. The Morasurco volcano is enclosed by the Buesaco and Aranda Fault segments."

16473198,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burhanuddin_Harahap,Burhanuddin Harahap,"Abstract. Burhanuddin Harahap (EVO: Boerhanoeddin Harahap; 12 February 1917 – 14 June 1987) was an Indonesian politician and lawyer who served as prime minister of Indonesia from August 1955 until March 1956. He was a member of the Masyumi Party and served as Minister of Defense concurrently with his tenure as prime minister. Afterward, he took part in the unsuccessful Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) rebellion in West Sumatra. He was born into a Batak family in North Sumatra. He moved to Java to pursue higher education, becoming active in Islamic student organizations and enrolling in the Rechts Hogeschool in Batavia (now Jakarta) before his studies were interrupted by the Japanese invasion in 1942. During the Japanese occupation, he served as a public prosecutor in state courts in Jakarta and Yogyakarta. Following the proclamation of Indonesian independence, he became more involved in politics, joining Masyumi and rising through its ranks to become a prominent party member, becoming the leader of Masyumi's parliamentary faction by 1950. In 1953, Burhanuddin contributed to the collapse of Prime Minister Wilopo 's cabinet and unsuccessfully attempted to form a new cabinet. After the downfall of Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo 's first cabinet, he was given another chance and formed a caretaker government with the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and several minor political parties. As prime minister, Burhanuddin reversed many of his predecessor's policies. He adopted a pragmatic economic policy, abolishing the pro-indigenous Benteng program, while seeking to remove the influence of the Indonesian National Party and Indonesian Communist Party from the military and government. Additionally, his government initiated some measures towards Acehnese autonomy and dissolved the Netherlands-Indonesian Union in 1956. The poor performance of Masyumi in the 1955 election, however, weakened the cabinet's political position and alliance with NU. In the last weeks of his government, international negotiations over the Western New Guinea dispute broke down the coalition, with his tenure ending in March 1956. Political tensions forced him to flee to Sumatra in 1957, and he joined PRRI upon its declaration in February 1958. Within PRRI, Burhanuddin was appointed minister of defense and justice in the revolutionary government's declared cabinet. Following continued military setbacks of the movement, the movement's leaders retreated into the jungles and mountains, and by August 1961 Burhanuddin had surrendered to authorities. Initially permitted to remain free, he was arrested in March 1962 and imprisoned until Sukarno's fall in 1966. Following his release, he largely left politics, although he took part in the 1980 Petition of Fifty documents, which criticized President Suharto 's use of Pancasila against political opponents before he died in 1987. Early life and career. Burhanuddin was born in Medan on 12 February 1917, the second child of Mohammad Yunus, a low-ranking official in a public prosecutor's office, and his wife Siti Nurfiah. Yunus was of South Tapanuli Batak descent and was often reassigned to other locations across North Sumatra. Burhanuddin followed his father's reassignments, and he went to a Hollandsch-Inlandsche School in Bagansiapiapi. After graduating, he continued his education at a Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs in Padang, then an Algemene Middelbare School in Yogyakarta, from which he graduated in 1938. He continued his education at the Rechts Hogeschool (Batavia Law Institute), but his studies were interrupted by the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies in 1942. He later resumed his law degree at Gadjah Mada University, completing it in 1951. During his time in Yogyakarta, Burhanuddin joined the Jong Islamieten Bond in 1936, becoming its activist and local chair. When he moved to Batavia, he became the secretary of the Studenten Islam Studie-Club, an organization that had split off from the Bond in 1934. He also became a member of the Indonesian Students' Association. Along with Jusuf Wibisono and Mohammad Roem, Burhanuddin organized the publication of the Dutch-language journal Moslim Reveil espousing Indonesian Islamic nationalism. Early political career. Between 1942 and 1948, Burhanuddin served as a public prosecutor in the Jakarta State Court and later the Yogyakarta State Court. When the Masyumi Islamic party was formed in November 1945, Burhanuddin became a member, although he did not initially hold any leadership position. Due to internal disputes within Masyumi, however, Burhanuddin became more involved and quickly went up the party ranks, being elected to a leadership position by 1949. He was also appointed by Sutan Sjahrir to the Working Body of the Central Indonesian National Committee in 1946. Burhanuddin, along with fellow Masyumi politician Kasman Singodimedjo, also lobbied the Indonesian Army in 1948 in favor of the Darul Islam movement and its founding of Islamist militia units during the Indonesian National Revolution. By 1950, Burhanuddin had become the leader of Masyumi's parliamentary faction in the Provisional People's Representative Council. During the prime ministership of Mohammad Natsir (a Masyumi member), Burhanuddin found himself within the wing of Masyumi which had significant disagreements with the prime minister, and he abstained in the parliamentary vote of confidence against Natsir in October 1950. In 1952, Burhanuddin became a member of Masyumi's Executive Committee. Burhanuddin was also initially appointed as Masyumi's representative to the Central Electoral Committee in April 1953 during the premiership of Wilopo, but disputes with the Indonesian National Party (PNI) over the committee composition caused it to fail to convene. Burhanuddin also contributed to the collapse of the cabinet later that year, when he threatened to withdraw Masyumi's support for the government over a successful motion to establish formal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. After the collapse of Wilopo's cabinet, two initial attempts at forming a new government by PNI and Masyumi failed, and after a series of negotiations between the two parties Burhanuddin was appointed formateur by President Sukarno on 8 July 1953. While Burhanuddin was acceptable to the PNI, and he was willing to make some concessions regarding policy and ministerial posts, the PNI rejected Burhanuddin's offer due to his selection of Indonesian Socialist Party (PSI) member Sumitro Djojohadikusumo as Finance Minister and PNI's desire for the prime ministership itself. Burhanuddin attempted to form a cabinet without PNI by including the Christian and Catholic Parties, but the two parties refused to participate in a government that excluded PNI. After this failure, Burhanuddin returned his mandate to Sukarno on 18 July, before the deadline given to him by Sukarno. His succeeding formateur, Wongsonegoro of the Great Indonesia Unity Party, managed to organize the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet which excluded Masyumi from ministerial posts. Prime Minister: 1955–1956. PRRI rebellion. In late 1957, the political situation in Indonesia rapidly grew unfavorable – the failure of the United Nations General Assembly to take up the Western New Guinea dispute had resulted in Sukarno forcefully nationalizing Dutch companies and property, and an unsuccessful assassination attempt was made on Sukarno, killing many children. Burhanuddin and other Masyumi leaders were especially in the spotlight, due to his cabinet's economic policy which was perceived to have benefited foreign importers and Chinese Indonesians. Burhanuddin, along with other Masyumi leaders such as Natsir and Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, were investigated for the assassination attempt. Indonesian newspapers began to attack the three figures, and rumors spread that they had been killed or arrested – some of Burhanuddin's family members travelled from Sumatra to Jakarta, believing that he had died. In early December 1957, Burhanuddin opted to flee Jakarta when he heard that he would be arrested. Within the following month, the other leaders followed him. Under the auspices of visiting a friend, Burhanuddin was in Padang in mid-January 1958, and along with other Masyumi leaders, he attended a conference at the town of Sungai Dareh with dissident military officers. In later accounts, Burhanuddin claimed that the military officers were advocating Sumatran secession from Indonesia, which he and other civilian leaders opposed. In the following weeks, with Sukarno abroad, the government in Jakarta under Prime Minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja attempted to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, with Masyumi members who had not fled to Sumatra – such as Roem – attempting to persuade Natsir, Sjafruddin, and Burhanuddin not to form a subversive government. On 10 February 1958, the dissident military officers under Ahmad Husein issued an ultimatum to the central government – the dissolution of the Djuanda Cabinet and the formation of a new cabinet by Vice President Hatta and Defense Minister Hamengkubuwono IX. When the central government rejected the ultimatum, the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) was declared on 15 February 1958 in Padang. Burhanuddin was appointed as minister of defense and justice in the government's declared cabinet. Burhanuddin later claimed that he was not fully in favor of forming a rival government, that he had only agreed to be appointed minister of home affairs simply so there could be a cabinet, and that the military officers had reassigned him without consultation. The rebellion soon faced major military defeats against the Indonesian government, which had captured the major rebel-held cities of Padang, Medan, and Pekanbaru by May 1958 while facing comparatively little armed resistance. This also brought down any possibility of a foreign intervention – namely of the United States which had unrealized hopes for a general uprising against Sukarno. PRRI soon was forced into guerilla warfare, with Burhanuddin being attached to Dahlan Djambek 's northern sector based in Agam Regency. Due to continued government military pressure, however, they were soon dislodged from their bases there and into the jungles and mountains of Sumatra, with the final major PRRI stronghold of Koto Tinggi being taken in July 1960. After the loss of their base, PRRI's civilian leaders could no longer exercise any control over the movement. By 1961, Army Chief of Staff Abdul Haris Nasution was negotiating with the rebel army officers, offering general amnesty. With Husein surrendering his forces on 21 June, most of the civilian leaders realized that the movement was hopeless. On 17 August 1961, Sukarno offered another general amnesty for any PRRI members who surrendered before 5 October 1961. Along with Sjafruddin and Assaat, Burhanuddin first called for PRRI forces to cease hostilities against the Indonesian government, before surrendering to military authorities at Padangsidempuan in late August 1961. PRRI's leadership was now reduced to just Natsir and Djambek, and with the death of the latter in September, Natsir surrendered too, ending the rebellion. Burhanuddin was initially brought to Medan after Natsir's surrender and was initially permitted to remain free. However, he was arrested along with the other PRRI civilian leaders in March 1962 and brought to Jakarta, before being separated from the others and incarcerated in Pati Regency for two years. He was brought back to Jakarta for continued imprisonment in 1964. He would be released following the fall of Sukarno, being let out along with other Masyumi leaders in July 1966. Later life and death. After his release, there were attempts by former Masyumi leaders to reform the party – and Burhanuddin along with the other leaders attended a meeting of Parmusi in August 1968. However, it soon became clear that Suharto would not accept a Parmusi under Masyumi's leadership, rejecting the party's leadership as elected by members in a November 1968 congress. Burhanuddin himself did not show much interest in obtaining a party leadership position, instead turning to other fields. He lobbied for the restoration of the Abadi daily newspaper, and later became its chief editor between 1968 and 1974. He was also active in the Indonesian Dakwah Council. In 1980, Suharto gave a speech decrying communism and religion as ""discredited philosophies"", and promoted Pancasila in their place. This caused a backlash from both Muslim groups and the armed forces, and many retired figures including Burhanuddin came together to sign the ""Petition of Fifty "" on 13 May 1980. The petition condemned Suharto's use of Pancasila as a political weapon against opposition. He died in Jakarta's Harapan Kita Cardiac Hospital on 14 June 1987, after having suffered from heart problems since 1976. He was buried in the Tanah Kusir Cemetery. Personal life and family. Burhanuddin was described as a fan of tennis and sambal, the former since his time as a student in Yogyakarta. He married Siti Bariyah, the daughter of a local official in Yogyakarta. The couple is known to have a son and a daughter, and no grandchildren at the time of Burhanuddin's death."

9836759,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_(Whigfield_song),Saturday Night (Whigfield song),"Abstract. ""Saturday Night "" is a song by Italian Eurodance project Whigfield, fronted by Danish-born Sannie Charlotte Carlson. It was first released in 1992 in Italy and 1993 in Spain through Prodisc. Throughout 1994, it was released across the rest of Europe and experienced worldwide success. The song was written by Italian producers Larry Pignagnoli and Davide Riva and produced by Pignagnoli. In 1995, the song was included on Whigfield's debut album, Whigfield. The single entered at number one on the UK Singles Chart, making Whigfield the first artist to enter at the top in the UK with their debut single, dethroning Wet Wet Wet 's 15-week chart-topper ""Love Is All Around "". As of October 2015, ""Saturday Night"" has sold a total of 1.18 million copies in the UK. It also reached number one in Germany, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland, and it became a top-10 hit in Austria, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. In Spain the single spent 11 weeks at the top position. Outside Europe, it peaked at number three in Zimbabwe, number 19 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart and number 78 in Australia. NME magazine ranked ""Saturday Night"" at number 15 in their list of the 50 best songs of 1994. It was also nominated for Best Single, while Whigfield was nominated for Best New Act on the 7th annual Smash Hits Awards in 1995. Background and composition. Whigfield (AKA Sannie Charlotte Carlson) studied fashion design in Copenhagen and went to Bologna in Italy where she worked as a model by day and as a PR girl for clubs at night. One of the club DJs, Davide Riva, was part of a music production duo. He persuaded her to work for them. She then visited Italian producer Larry Pignagnoli in his studio, he hired her to perform ""Saturday Night"" and they chose the name Whigfield. Larry Pignagnoli already had success with Spagna in the late 1980s and early 1990s before he produced ""Saturday Night"" with Whigfield. With lyrics written by Pignagnoli in three days, the duo did over 20 takes, then they spliced the best bits together. Reviews categorized ""Saturday Night"" as a melodic bubblegum -influenced pop-dance and Euro-pop track. James Hamilton from the Record Mirror Dance Update compared it to ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy "". ""Saturday Night"" includes a rave -tinted rhythm section, and a house piano at its fade-out. According to Whigfield, ""Saturday Night"" is ""like a nursery rhyme, with lyrics about what girls do when they're getting ready to go out, and about getting hot when they’re out dancing."" The ""Dee dee na na na "" was initially done as a joke, before they incorporated it as an initial hook. They chose to release the song for its simple, upbeat and club-ready nature, titling it ""Saturday Night"" to reflect that. The lyrical subject led Simon Cowell to compare it to Rebecca Black 's ""Friday "", stating that they are ""what we call a 'hair-dryer song'; a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out"". Release and commercial performance. Initially, no record companies were interested in publishing ""Saturday Night"". After it was played frequently in the Spanish radio show World Dance Music, interest in the song began to increase. The first label to pick up the song was a small label, Prodisc in Valencia. It was first released in Italy in 1992, then became a number-one hit in Spain at the end of 1993. In the summer of 1994, it became a hit with British holidaymakers on the continent, leading to a huge demand for the track in the United Kingdom. Whigfield was signed for the UK in February 1994 by Christian Tattersfield and Ben Kahn who run London offshoot Systematic. The label decided to delay the release in order to capitalise on the inevitable buzz built up among British tourists returning from summer holidays in mainland Europe. The single was not released in North America until February 1995. ""Saturday Night"" was released in the UK on 5 September 1994, and went straight to number one - dethroning Wet Wet Wet 's 15 week chart-topper ""Love Is All Around "" on 11 September, despite that single increasing its sales from 65,000 the previous week to 104,000, when ""Saturday Night"" entered at number one with sales of 150,000. Whigfield was the first act to enter at number one in the United Kingdom chart with her debut single. It stayed at number one for a total of four weeks selling 680,000 in the process, went on to become the second best selling single of the year, and has sold a total of 1.18 million copies. ""Saturday Night"" is also the 15th biggest-selling single by a female artist in the United Kingdom. It also was a No. 1 hit in Germany, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland, and a No. 2 hit in Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy and Norway. In Spain, the single spent a total of 11 weeks at number-one. Additionally, it reached the top 10 also in Austria (4), the Netherlands (7) and Sweden (9), while it was a top-20 hit in Belgian Flanders (14). Outside Europe, it peaked at number-one on the RPM Dance/Urban chart in Canada, No. 3 in Israel and Zimbabwe, No. 19 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in the United States and No. 78 in Australia. Critical reception. ""Saturday Night"" was well-received by professional critics, both contemporaneous and retrospective pieces labeling the track as ""irresistible"", ""catchy"", and ""infectious"". Larry Flick from Billboard wrote that it ""is a giddy pop/dance ditty that has already saturated radio airwaves throughout Europe. It also has gotten early spins on crossover stations in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Nashville —and rightly so. The tune has a simple, but killer hook that is matched by a jumpy, rave -coated rhythm section and chirpy female vocals."" Another Billboard editor, Mark Dezzani, declared it a ""teen anthem"". Chris Heath from The Daily Telegraph felt it's ""pleasantly annoying"", saying, ""It's pop music. Don't be too cool to enjoy it."" David Balls from Digital Spy noted its ""feelgood Euro beats and memorable dance routine"". Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger complimented it for being ""one of those iconically simple pop hits"" and for its ""resistibility"". He also added that the song is ""charmingly unassuming, thanks mainly to Whigfield's matter-of-fact performance. If you do stick around, your reward is a lovely bit of house piano heading for the fade. But this song is never pushy. It's Saturday night. Whigfield is having a great time."" A reviewer from Music Week called it ""delightful frothy pop"", and Stephen Meade from The Network Forty considered it as ""exciting"". NME named ""Saturday Night"" a ""much misunderstood dancefloor classic"", while Gavin Hills from The Observer praised it as ""wonderful"". Music video. The official music video for ""Saturday Night"" was directed by La La Land and filmed in London. It features numerous different scenes of Whigfield standing in front of a mirror, getting ready to go out on Saturday night. She's blow-drying her wet hair, before she braids it and puts on make-up. In some scenes, she flips through pictures of different men and selects one of them, which she kisses and attaches to the mirror. In the video for her next single, ""Another Day "", the same image appears, this time in a frame.

There is a dance routine which is commonly performed to the song (particularly at parties and nightclubs in the United Kingdom), the origins of which are uncertain. Some suggest that it began as an aerobic routine created by a gym instructor to accompany the song at a holiday resort, and followed the song back to the UK. The dance does not appear in the music video for the song, however it was performed by backing dancers during Whigfield's performance on Top of the Pops on 15 September 1994. Whigfield stated in an interview with Justin Myers for the Official Charts Company, ""I remember I did some promotion in this place north of Madrid and when I was doing the track saw everybody doing this thing and they all jumped at the same time. I hadn’t even known about the dance until then... I still remember the dance, but I didn’t do it. I thought it was kind of nice that it was just the people doing it."" Allegations of plagiarism. Two claims of plagiarism were made. It was alleged that the track ripped off both ""Rub a Dub Dub"" by the Equals and ""Fog on the Tyne "" by Lindisfarne. Both claims were dismissed. Impact and legacy. The Guardian ranked ""Saturday Night"" number 91 in their list of ""The 100 greatest UK No. 1s"" in 2020. NME ranked it number 15 in their list of the ""50 best songs of 1994"". Smash Hits nominated the song and act in the categories for Best New Single and Best New Act on the 7th annual Smash Hits Awards in 1995. The song was played in the British TV series Everything I Know About Love (2022–present)."

Clay Drewry Blair Jr. (May 1, 1925 – December 16, 1998) was an American journalist and author, best known for his books on military history. Blair wrote some two dozen history books and hundreds of magazine articles that reached a popular audience. Early life and military service. Blair was born in Lexington, Virginia. Blair enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943, during World War II. Around 1944, he attended Basic Enlisted Submarine School followed by Quartermaster Class A School, after which he was assigned to Sperry (AS-12), a submarine tender. During 1945, Blair was posted to the fleet submarine Guardfish (SS-217). He was on that boat's last two war patrols off Japan. Blair served on Guardfish into 1946, after the war was over, then was discharged from the Navy. His highest rank was Quartermaster 2nd Class. Education and journalism career. Blair attended both Tulane University and Columbia University. He attended the first as a prospective architecture student, but decided instead to go to New York and attend the Columbia School of Journalism. In the end, he did not graduate from either institutions. Blair later wrote for Time and Life magazines. At Time-Life during the 1950s he covered the Pentagon, focusing on issues of national security and nuclear weapons policy. Over the years, Blair worked for the Curtis Publishing Company as both a correspondent and an editor. In particular, he became editor-in-chief of The Saturday Evening Post during the early 1960s. During his stint there, he made an emphasis of publishing exclusive reports but also faced a series of libel suits, at least one of which was successful. Beginning in 1962, Blair was also in editorial charge of all of Curtis Publishing's other magazines in addition to the Post, and held the titles of executive vice president and directory. He departed Curtis Publishing in 1964 during a struggle for control of the company. Following that, he became a full-time freelance writer. He lived in Wisconsin but often travelled to various locations to research materials for his books. He was for many years married to Joan Blair, who co-wrote some of his books. Prior to that marriage he was married to Agnes Kemp Devereux Blair, with whom he had seven children. That marriage resulted in a divorce. Historian. One of Blair's first books, The Hydrogen Bomb: The Men, The Menace, The Mechanism (1954), was co-written with Time ' s Washington bureau chief, James R. Shepley, and provoked considerable controversy at the time with its charges that the U.S. development of the hydrogen bomb had been intentionally delayed by some scientists led by J. Robert Oppenheimer and that the Los Alamos Laboratory had been infiltrated by Communists. While the book was positively reviewed across a large number of newspapers and magazines at the time of publication, several scientists who had worked at Los Alamos on the bomb's development soon issued statements refuting its narrative. Interviews conducted during the mid-to-late-1950s (but not published until many decades later) showed almost no scientists speaking well of the book, even those portrayed favorably within it. Subsequent scholarship has established that the Shepley and Blair account was largely inaccurate and was guided by stark H-bomb proponent, and Oppenheimer antagonist, Lewis Strauss. Blair later earned trust as a collaborator when he assisted General Omar Bradley in the writing of his autobiography, A General's Life (1983), published after the general's death. Blair's history of the Korean War The Forgotten War: America in Korea, 1950–1953 (1987) is considered one of the definitive historical works on the war. This work was notable for its criticism of senior American political and military leaders. Blair criticizes President Harry S. Truman and his Secretary of Defense, Louis A. Johnson, for failing to maintain the military's readiness in the years immediately following World War II. His history, while comprehensive, primarily employs a top-down perspective, with less emphasis on individual soldiers than on larger operational issues and the perspectives of general and field-grade officers. He has also been criticized by some historians for not making sufficient use of Communist sources. Blair also wrote extensively on the submarine war of World War II, notably in the bestselling Silent Victory: The U.S. Submarine War Against Japan (1975), considered the definitive work on the Pacific submarine war. Silent Victory was also Blair's most popular book. It, and several other of this works, were selected by various kinds of book of the month clubs, a target audience that Blair and his wife aimed at. Blair's last books were Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunters, 1939–1942 (1996), followed by Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunted, 1942–1945 (1998). The first of these was criticized by Gary E. Weir of the U.S. Naval Historical Center. Weir pointed out the lack of footnotes in the text, Blair's inability to read German and dependence on translations, his failure to consult the German Federal Military Archives or Michael Salawski's book Die deutsche Seekriegsleitung, 1935-1945 as well as his ""painfully obvious bias in favor of the U.S. Navy, and expressions of stereotypical sarcasm aimed at the French and Italians."" Weir said that Blair ""missed the point"" by failing to appreciate the ""technically and strategically revolutionary"" nature of the Type XXI U-boat and preferring to focus on ""solvable engineering problems"". Weir dismissed Blair's fundamental assumptions and theses on the German Navy as primitive and anachronistic and called Hitler's U-Boat War a ""handicapped chronicle"". Novelist. Blair also published fiction, such as Pentagon Country (1970). His novels tended to have military settings and focus on themes of ambition and hypocrisy. Death.

Company B, 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery (1861-1864) was a Confederate Army artillery battery during the American Civil War. While the unit was assigned to a Tennessee Artillery Regiment, it was originally organized as the McCown Guards or the McCown Guards Artillery, a volunteer company organized in Lafayette County, Arkansas. Also known as: Company A, 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery and/or Dismukes' Battery. Organization. An infantry company known as the ""McCown Guards"", was recruited in Columbia and Lafayette counties, Arkansas and organized at Lamartine, Arkansas, on December 6, 1861, under the command of Captain Datus Whitaker (Whit) Harris. Captain Harris succeeded as captain by First Lieut. Paul Thomas Dismukes, date uncertain. Dismukes had originally served as a Sergeant in the Invincible Guards, a militia company raised at Magnolia, in Columbia County, Arkansas, which became a company in the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops. The company was originally recruited for the 15th (Johnson/Gee) Arkansas Infantry, but was sidetracked into the artillery service before it joined the 15th Arkansas. The unit was sent east of the Mississippi River, and converted to an artillery battery where it would eventually be assigned to the 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery as (2nd) Company A. One of the original company offices, First Lieutenant William M. Hughey, would go on to serve in Shoup's Mountain Battery and the 8th Arkansas Field Battery. Service. Dismuke's battery probably first became associated with heavy artillery at Columbus, Kentucky in the winter of 1862. While initially serving as the first major Confederate bastion on the Mississippi River, Columbus became untendable when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862. Columbus was cut off from rest of the Confederate Army, and faced capture by Union troops advancing overland from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi. To avoid losing the garrison and its equipment, General Beauregard ordered that the position be abandoned as quietly as possible. The process began on February 24, when the first members of the Columbus garrison arrived at Island No. 10. Two days later, its new commander, Brig. Gen. John P. McCown, arrived, and immediately set to work to strengthen the position McCown, was able to transform the island and nearby mainland into a formidable obstacle for any fleet attempting to pass. By the middle of March, five batteries containing 24 guns had been built on the shore above the island; 19 guns were in five batteries on the island itself; and the floating battery New Orleans, with nine guns, was moored at the west end of the island. McCown was eventually replaced in command at the island by Brig. Gen. William W. Mackall. Surrender. The Army of the Trans-Mississippi was surrendered by General Kirby Smith on May 26, 1865. The date of the military convention between Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith and Union General Edward Canby for the surrender of the troops and public property in the Trans-Mississippi Department was May 26, 1865, however, it took a while for parole commissioners to be appointed and for public property to be accounted for. As a result, a final report of field artillery which was part of the accounting process, was not completed until June 1, 1865. Capt. Paul T. Dismukes' 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery, is not listed in the final accounting of Confederate Government property in the Department of the Trans-Mississippi. It may be that the organization had been consolidated with other units or disbanded altogether before the surrender."

18695611,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire_(Michael_Martin_Murphey_song),Wildfire (Michael Martin Murphey song),"Abstract. ""Wildfire "" is a song written by Michael Murphey and Larry Cansler. It was originally recorded by Murphey, who had yet to add his middle name to his recorded work, and appears on his gold -plus 1975 album Blue Sky – Night Thunder. Released in February 1975 as the album's lead single, ""Wildfire"" became Murphey's highest-charting pop hit in the United States. The somber story song hit No. 2 in Cash Box and No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in June 1975. In addition, it hit the top position of the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, displacing ""Love Will Keep Us Together "". The single continued to sell, eventually receiving platinum certification from the RIAA, signifying sales of over two million US copies. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Background. Murphey and Cansler co-wrote ""Wildfire"" in 1968, shortly after Murphey emerged as a solo artist. Earlier in the decade he had been part of a duo known as the Lewis & Clark Expedition in 1968 with singer-songwriter Boomer Castleman. They appeared and performed in an episode of the TV sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. When Murphey rerecorded ""Wildfire"" for a new album in 1997, he was quoted by Billboard as saying that what many consider his signature song ""broke my career wide open and, on some level, still keeps it fresh. Because that song appeals to kids, and always has, it's kept my career fresh."" In a 2008 interview, Murphey talked about the origins of the song and the context in which it was written. He was a third-year student at UCLA, working on a concept album for Kenny Rogers (The Ballad of Calico). The work was demanding, sometimes taking more than 20 hours a day. One night, he dreamed the song in its totality, writing it up in a few hours the next morning. He believes the song came to him from a story his grandfather told him when he was a little boy – a prominent Native American legend about a ghost horse. Murphey did not have a horse named Wildfire until a few years before the interview, when he gave that name to a palomino mare. Content. The lyrics are those of a homesteader telling the story of a young Nebraska woman said to have died searching for her escaped pony, ""Wildfire"", during a blizzard. The homesteader finds himself in a similar situation, doomed in an early winter storm. A hoot owl has perched outside of his window for six nights, and the homesteader believes the owl is a sign that the ghost of the young woman is calling for him. He hopes to join her (presumably in heaven) and spend eternity riding Wildfire with her, leaving the difficulties of earthly life behind. The song has a piano intro and outro which was edited out for radio. The introduction is based on a piece (Prelude in D-flat, Op. 11 No. 15) by the Russian classical composer Alexander Scriabin. Personnel. In popular culture. In 2007, the host of The Late Show, David Letterman, developed a sudden fascination with ""Wildfire"", discussing the song and its lyrics—particularly the line about ""leave sodbustin' behind""—with the bandleader Paul Shaffer over the course of several weeks. This ultimately led to Murphey's being invited on the show to perform ""Wildfire"". Letterman described the song as ""haunting and disturbingly mysterious, but always lovely,"" and surmised that the performance would leave the studio audience with ""a palpable sense of... mysticism, melancholy... and uplifting well-being."" In a third-season episode of The Simpsons named ""Lisa's Pony "", Lisa played the song for her pony with her saxophone. She introduced the song by saying ""This next song is also about a girl and her pony. It's called 'Wildfire'."" The song has occasionally appeared in ""bad song"" surveys, such as one by the humor columnist Dave Barry during the 1990s. He quoted one reader who, referring to the song's tale of the loss of a woman and a pony in a ""killing frost"", pointed out that ""'killing' in 'killing frost' refers to your flowers and your garden vegetables, and when one is forecast you should cover your tomatoes... Nobody ever got lost in a killing frost who wouldn't get lost in July as well."" Covers."

Milan struggles begun immediately, with misunderstandings between a coach with somewhat rough methods and players with little character. Franco Baresi 's long absence due to a rare blood disease precipitated the situation. The team never left the relegation zone, the players seemed apathetic, and not even the open protests of the fans helped shaking them. Everything was tried, from the change of president (from Gaetano Morazzoni to Giuseppe Farina in January 1982) and coach (from Radice to Galbiati) to the unusual one of the captain (from Aldo Maldera to Fulvio Collovati), with few results. In the last five league games, however, with 8 points out of 10 available, Milan attempted a desperate comeback. At the final whistle of the last match, won 3–2 by Milan against Cesena), the team was virtually safe, but the last minutes of the Napoli-Genoa match were still being played in Naples; as a consequence of a sensational mistake by the Neapolitan goalkeeper Castellini, Genoa equalized, condemning Milan to their second relegation.

Members of Seanad Éireann, the second house of the Oireachtas, are partly nominated, partly indirectly elected, and partly elected by graduates of particular universities. Coalition governments have been the norm since 1989. Fine Gael (or its predecessor Cumann na nGaedheal) or Fianna Fáil have led every government since independence in 1922. The current government is a coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party. Traditionally, the Labour Party was the third party, although since 2016 it has been surpassed by Sinn Féin, and since 2020 by the Green Party. Smaller parties and independents exist in the Dáil and more so in local government. Since 2023, electoral operations and oversight of electoral integrity have been carried out by an independent Electoral Commission. Early voting. Military personnel, whether serving at home or abroad, vote by postal ballot. These votes are delivered by a courier service, usually a commercial one, but a military courier is used for ballots cast by Irish troops in Lebanon and Syria. Voters living on islands off the west coast in counties Galway, Mayo, and Donegal traditionally voted two or three days before polling day, but in 2014 the gap was narrowed, when they voted just one day beforehand. Following an amendment to electoral law in 2022, early voting on the islands is allowed only in exceptional circumstances. Seanad elections. Elections to Seanad Éireann take place after the general election to the Dáil. There are sixty members of the Seanad. Of these, eleven are nominated by the Taoiseach appointed next after the dissolution of the Dáil. Six are elected by STV in university constituencies: three for the National University (by graduates) and three for Dublin University (by graduates and scholars of Trinity College Dublin). Forty-three are elected by an electorate of serving politicians (members of the incoming Dáil, the outgoing Seanad, and city and county councillors) for five vocational panels. These elections are also counted using STV, although using a different set of rules on the distribution of surpluses and the order of counts than in other elections in Ireland. European elections. Elections to the European Parliament are held simultaneously across Europe every five years. In Ireland, as for Dáil elections, STV is used in constituencies returning three to five members. Ireland has 13 seats in the European Parliament. Local elections. Elections to county councils, city councils and city and county councils are held every five years and by convention take place on the same day as European elections. Local electoral areas (LEAs) return between three and seven councillors by STV. Until the Local Government Reform Act 2014, elections were also held for borough and town councils. The 2014 Act abolished borough and town councils with their functions transferred to municipal districts of the county councils, comprising the county councillors from the LEA coterminous with the district. Some members of Údarás na Gaeltachta were directly elected by Gaeltacht residents between 1980 and 2012; since then all have been appointed by the government. Presidential elections. The President of Ireland is formally elected by the citizens of Ireland once in every seven years, except in the event of premature vacancy, when an election must be held within sixty days. The President is directly elected by secret ballot under the system of the instant-runoff voting (although the Constitution describes it as ""the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote""). While both Irish and British citizens resident in the state may vote in Dáil elections, only Irish citizens, who must be at least eighteen years of age, may vote in the election of the President. The presidency is open to all citizens of the state who are at least 35. A candidate must be nominated by one of the following: Where only one candidate is nominated, that candidate is declared elected without a ballot. No one may serve as President for more than two terms. Referendums. The Constitution of Ireland was approved by plebiscite on 1 July 1937. The Constitution recognises two types of referendums: There have been 38 referendums for amendments to the Constitution of Ireland. There have been no ordinary referendums. From 1998 to 2019, a Referendum Commission was established for each referendum to provide neutral information. From 2023, this function is carried out by the Electoral Commission. An organisation can register with the commission as an ""approved body"" in order to campaign publicly for or against the proposal, and to have monitors in polling stations and counting agents at count centres. For a proposal to change the name of a place, a plebiscite is required. The current 1956 regulations on conducting such plebiscites relate to a postal vote of ratepayers; in 2019 the relevant electorate was changed from ratepayers to local electors, but as of 16 January 2020 the regulations have not been updated accordingly. In a County Cork town, Charleville was chosen in a 1989 four-option plebiscite ahead of Ráth Luirc, An Rath, and Rathgoggan. The Official Languages Act 2003 prevented the plebiscite provision applying to places in the Gaeltacht, and so a 2005 plebiscite to change the name of Dingle, County Kerry was ruled invalid; in 2011 the 2003 act was amended to remove the restriction. Other local plebiscites include three in 2019 for directly-elected mayors for Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council, of which only that for Limerick was passed."

66228012,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Zelenko,Vladimir Zelenko,"Abstract. Vladimir Zelenko (November 27, 1973 – June 30, 2022) was an American family physician. He was born in Kyiv. At the age of three, his family moved to the United States and settled in Brooklyn, New York City. He received his medical degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2000. He was an Orthodox Jew. As an author, he was known for promoting a three-drug combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc sulfate, and azithromycin as a treatment outpatient for COVID-19 that is called the Zelenko Protocol. Dr Vladimir Zelenko saved millions of lives to not economical benefit to himself by making his protocol free worldwide. As his findings put the true on the table he had and has many enemies. All those who tried to ridicularise him are simple slaves of the system that will be eliminated by the same ones that are serving to. He also promoted alternative medicine,as US government prohibited sales on hydroxicloroquine and Ivermectin over the counter and had to research on natural sources, quercetin, NAC and others to allow the Zinc to cross the cell membrane to stop the reproduction of the ""virus"" information about COVID-19 vaccination. On March 23, 2020, Zelenko published an open letter to U.S. president Donald Trump where he claimed to have successfully treated hundreds of COVID-19 patients with a five-day course of his protocol. Zelenko's treatment protocol quickly gained notoriety, with several right-wing media figures and various Trump administration officials promoting it, including Rudy Giuliani and then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, despite cautionary messages from health experts. This is dedicated to THE SLAVE THAT HAS PUBLISH THOSE LIES AGAINST ONE SOUL THAT HAVE SAVE MILLIONS WITH NO ECONOMICAL INTEREST.WAKE UP, YOU WILL NOT BE SPARE BY THOSE WHO YOU ARE SERVING Early life and education. Vladimir ""Zev"" Zelenko was born to Larisa (Portnoy) Zelenko and Alex in Kyiv (then, part of Soviet Ukraine), on November 27, 1973. His father was a taxi driver and his mother worked at a fur factory before working as a computer programmer at Morgan Stanley. His family moved to the U.S. when he was three years old, and settled in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City. Zelenko earned a Doctor of Medicine degree in 2000 from the State University of New York at Buffalo and subsequently specialized in family medicine. COVID-19 treatment and vaccine claims. On March 21, 2020, Zelenko posted a video to YouTube and Facebook addressed to U.S. president Donald Trump, in which he claimed to have successfully tested an experimental treatment for COVID-19 on hundreds of patients with coronavirus-like symptoms. He described the treatment as a three-drug combination consisting of the anti-malarial medication hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin, and zinc sulfate, and posted an open letter to Trump with similar claims two days later. At the time, ongoing research was being conducted by various groups, including the World Health Organization, to determine the efficacy of using hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin to treat COVID-19. In March 2020, Alex Kasprak, a science writer for Snopes, noted that since Zelenko did not describe his study design nor publish any data, his claims were unverifiable. In July 2020, the month after FDA withdrew emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, Zelenko coauthored a retrospective study of 141 COVID-19 outpatients who were prescribed a combination of zinc, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin. Zelenko's study compared the outcomes of treated patients to untreated patients in his New York community, with hospitalization rates of 2.8% for treated patients and 15.4% for untreated. Based on the study, Zelenko said that his combination therapy ""resulted in five times less hospitalizations and deaths"". A higher quality RECOVERY trial (Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy) comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 foundthat patients who received hydroxychloroquine ""did not have a lower incidence of death at 28 days than those who received usual care."" However, since this study used hospitalized patients it may not be directly applicable to Zelenko's focus on early treatment. The National Institutes of Health ultimately recommended against the use of zinc, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in treatments for COVID-19. The Satmar Hasidic community in Kiryas Joel, New York in Monroe, New York, where Zelenko was a long-time community physician, disputed Zelenko's claims about the potential infection rate in the community, which prompted Zelenko to shut down his office after nearly 20 years. In December 2020, Twitter suspended Zelenko's account for violating rules against ""platform manipulation and spam"". In 2021, Zelenko began selling a dietary supplement called Z-Stack, which contained zinc and several vitamins. Fact-checkers noted the lack of scientific support for Zelenko's claims of Z-Stack's ingredients boosting immunity, killing the virus that causes COVID-19, and preventing hospitalization. In January 2022, Zelenko falsely claimed that children are more likely to die from COVID-19 vaccines than from COVID-19. Personal life. Zelenko was twice married and had eight children. In 2019, Zelenko published an autobiography, Metamorphosis, that explores his journey and transformation from an irreligious, Jewish Russian -American young man to a baal teshuva (newly religious Jew), which helped him form close ties with many diverse Jewish communities, and how circumstances in his life provided him with the willpower to overcome the challenges he has been handed, including a life-threatening disease. Zelenko also lectured about his personal story and the book he wrote about it. He also told of his personal journey in Mishpacha magazine. Also in 2019, Zelenko co-authored with one of his sons, Levi Yitzchok Zelenko, a book about Kabbalah, on Jewish mysticism, Hasidism, called Essence To Essence, which ""describes the metaphysical dynamics shared by science, medicine, psychology, economics, law, and politics"". Zelenko died at a hospital in Dallas where he was undergoing treatment for lung cancer on June 30, 2022, at the age of 48. He had been battling cancer for several years. He is survived by his wife and eight children."
42459405,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nuclear_Beauty_Parlor,The Nuclear Beauty Parlor,"Abstract. The Nuclear Beauty Parlor is a group of women artists active in protest and performance art, primarily during the nuclear freeze movement from 1983 to 1986 in San Francisco. Their name is synonymous with a music project they originated, the 45-RPM 7-inch single, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor. Two members of the Nuclear Beauty Parlor wrote the lyrics to the song which debuted in the women’s jail following the 1983 blockade of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the largest anti-nuclear protests in the United States. The group staged numerous performances to attract media attention for the cause of nuclear disarmament. The record, conceived as an art prank, is archived in the Peace Library at Swarthmore College. The group is noted for adding humor and post-punk style to a dedicated protest movement. History. On May 24, 1983, ten women formed an affinity group to prepare for the mass arrests planned for the International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protest of June 20, 1983. They were trained in civil disobedience by Livermore Action Group. The female membership grew over the next 3 years, as they evolved into a performance art and activist art group. Founding member Vicki Krohn Amorose originally coined the name Nuclear Beauty Parlor and she, along with founding member Denise Slattery, wrote the lyrics to the Nuclear Beauty Parlor song. The group was not a band; they enacted political satire in the tradition of guerrilla theatre and performance activism. Activities. On June 20, 1983, the group participated in the blockade of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. More than 1000 demonstrators were arrested, including three members of the Nuclear Beauty Parlor, and jailed for 11 days in tents on the grounds of the Alameda County Jail. The group gained their first media attention with a San Francisco Examiner headline: Nuclear Beauty Parlor a Hit in Jail. During November and December,1983, the Nuclear Beauty Parlor acquired non-profit status, under the title Bay Area Energy Action. Bill Graham (promoter), San Francisco music impresario, funded production of the Nuclear Beauty Parlor 45-RPM 7-inch single. The lyrics were set to music and the record was produced by the group's friend and ally, Stacy Baird. Side A, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor, was performed by Re Styles and other members of The Tubes. Side B, Awake, was recorded at OTR Studios under the direction of Cookie Marenco. The Nuclear Beauty Parlor 45-RPM single was released and a press conference held on Dec 15,1983. Between January and April, 1984, the group solidified its identity as a performance art group with the goal of gaining media attention for the nuclear freeze movement. The record gained airplay and press. On April 16, 1984, the group performs the first in a series of ""Tax Day actions"" at Rincon Annex Post Office in Rincon Center. Playing to the audience of taxpayers lined up in cars to meet the midnight tax-filing deadline, the Nuclear Beauty Parlor interacted as costumed waitresses, served weapon-themed food, and encourage people to: ""Have one, you paid for it!"" They attracted attention from TV and newspaper reporters. The Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco on July 14 and 15, 1984. In conjunction with ""A Vision of America at Peace"", the Nuclear Beauty Parlor performed an original play with songs, titled ""The First Lady Debate"". The group recorded ""The First Lady Debate"" and distributed tapes to radio stations nationwide. On the eve of the Nov 6, 1984, presidential election, the group pasted thousands of anti-Reagan posters in downtown San Francisco, designed by artist Paul Mavrides, who also designed the record jacket. Although the posters were quickly removed after Ronald Reagan’s victory, photographer C. Baldwin captured the morning-after image and created a postcard. A December 1984 Ms. Magazine article on the group helped to boost record sales. In their second Tax Day performance at Rincon Annex Post Office on April 15, 1985, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor dressed as couture nuclear weapons with price tags, and interacted with last-minute taxpayers, resulting in local TV and press coverage. In July and September, 1985, the group adapted their nuclear weapon costumes for The Fashion Show presented by New Langton Arts. An original script read by the MC accompanied the runway show, titled ""The Nuclear Fashion Arsenal"", which was also performed a second time at Fort Mason for the International Day of Peace. In the group's third Tax Day performance, April 15, 1986, at Rincon Annex Post Office, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor enacted taxpayer robberies with pink machine guns. In the 1990s, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor record was housed in the Audio Visual Collection of the Swarthmore College Peace Collection. The group produced a PSA for the 2020 election. A Message From The Nuclear Beauty Parlor Members and Names. The founding group members are Marissa Hutter LaMagna, Diana Wendling, Denise Slattery, Laura Graham, Lisa Andreini, Cecilia London, Kathy Staats Hornbeak, Marjorie Newman, Vicki Krohn Amorose and Fawn Yacker.

498166,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D_Shinkansen,Chūō Shinkansen,"Abstract. The Chuo Shinkansen (中央新幹線, Central Shinkansen) is a Japanese maglev line under construction between Tokyo and Nagoya, with plans for extension to Osaka. Its initial section is between Shinagawa Station in Tokyo and Nagoya Station in Nagoya, with stations in Sagamihara, Kōfu, Iida and Nakatsugawa. Following the completion of the Tokyo–Nagoya line, the line will extend to connect stations in Mie, Nara and Osaka. The line is expected to connect Tokyo and Nagoya in 40 minutes, and eventually Tokyo and Osaka in 67 minutes, running at a maximum speed of 505 km/h (314 mph). About 90% of the 286-kilometer (178 mi) line to Nagoya will be tunnels. The Chuo Shinkansen is the culmination of Japanese maglev development since the 1970s, a government-funded project initiated by Japan Airlines and the former Japanese National Railways (JNR). Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) now operates the facilities and research. The line is intended to be built by extending and incorporating the existing Yamanashi test track (see below). The trainsets themselves are popularly known in Japan as linear motor car (リニアモーターカー, rinia mōtā kā), though there have been many technical variations. Government permission to proceed with construction was granted on 27 May 2011. Construction of the line, which is expected to cost over ¥ 9 trillion (approximately 82 billion USD), commenced in 2014. The start date of commercial service is currently unknown, after Shizuoka Prefecture denied permission for construction work on a portion of the route in June 2020. JR Central originally aimed to begin commercial service between Tokyo and Nagoya in 2027, with the Nagoya–Osaka section planned to be completed as early as 2037. Originally, the Nagoya–Osaka section was planned to be completed as late as 2045, but the date was moved up following a loan from the Japanese government. However, on 29 March 2024, Central Japan Railway Co President Shunsuke Niwa said that due to construction delays the original plan for a 2027 opening of the Tokyo-Nagoya section was now impossible and it is not expected to open until at least 2034. Development overview. Construction schedule and costs. JR Central announced in December 2007 that it planned to raise funds for the construction of the Chuo Shinkansen on its own, without government financing. Total cost, originally estimated at 5.1 trillion yen in 2007, escalated to over 9 trillion yen by 2011. Nevertheless, the company has said it can make a pre-tax profit of around 70 billion yen in 2026, when the operating costs stabilize. The primary reason for the project's huge expense is that most of the line is planned to run in tunnels (about 86% of the initial section from Tokyo to Nagoya will be underground) with some sections at a depth of 40 m (130 ft) (deep underground) for a total of 100 km (62 mi) in the Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka areas. The original construction schedule from 2013, which called for the Tokyo–Nagoya segment to open in 2027 and the Nagoya–Osaka segment to open in 2045, was designed to keep JR Central's total debt burden below its approximate level at the time of privatization (around 5 trillion yen). The schedule was later altered to bring forward the completion date of the Nagoya-Osaka segment to 2037, after JR Central received a loan from the Japanese government. The first major contract announced was for a 7 km (4.3 mi) tunnel in Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures expected to be completed in 2025. Construction of a 25 km (16 mi) tunnel under the southern Japanese Alps commenced on 20 December 2015, approximately 1,400 m (4,600 ft) below the surface at its deepest point. The tunnel is expected to be completed in 2025, and upon completion will succeed the 1,300 m (4,300 ft) deep Daishimizu Tunnel on the Joetsu Shinkansen line as the deepest tunnel in Japan. Construction has also started on the maglev station at Shinagawa. Being built below the existing Shinkansen station, and to consist of two platforms and four tracks, construction is planned to take 10 years, largely to avoid disruption to the existing Tokaido Shinkansen services located above the new station. JR Central estimates that Chuo Shinkansen fares will be only slightly more expensive than Tokaido Shinkansen fares, with a difference of around 700 yen between Tokyo and Nagoya, and around 1,000 yen between Tokyo and Osaka. The positive economic impact of the Chuo Shinkansen in reducing travel times between the cities has been estimated at anywhere between 5 and 17 trillion yen during the line's first fifty years of operation. Osaka extension. The government of Osaka Prefecture, as well as local corporations such as Suntory and Nippon Life, have raised concerns about the impact of the delayed construction of the Nagoya–Osaka segment on the Osaka economy. Politicians from the Kansai region called for, and received, state-backed loans for JR Central in order to expedite the line's construction, resulting in the opening of the extension being moved forward by up to 8 years. Construction accidents. On 27 October 2021, two construction workers died when part of the retaining wall of a temporary work tunnel collapsed. JR Central concluded that the safety checks carried out were insufficient, and vowed to make it clearer to workers which areas had and had not completed the safety checks necessary to allow for the presence of human workers going forward. Route. The line will run between Tokyo and Nagoya, with plans for extension to Osaka. Its initial section is between Shinagawa Station in Tokyo and Nagoya Station in Nagoya, with stations in Sagamihara, Kōfu, Iida, and Nakatsugawa. The line has one station for each prefecture it passes through, except for Shizuoka. The line is expected to connect Tokyo and Nagoya in 40 minutes, and eventually Tokyo and Osaka in 67 minutes, running at a maximum speed of 500 km/h (311 mph). About 90% of the 286-kilometer (178 mi) line to Nagoya will be in tunnels, with a minimum curve radius of 8,000 m (26,000 ft) and a maximum grade of 4% (1 in 25). Technology. The Chūō Shinkansen will employ the SCMaglev technology, a maglev (magnetic levitation train) system developed by JR Central. The levitating force is generated between superconducting magnets on the trains and coils on the track.The absence of wheel friction allows higher speed and higher acceleration and deceleration than conventional high-speed rail. The superconducting coils use Niobium–titanium alloy cooled to a temperature of −269 °C (4.15 K; −452 °F) with liquid helium. Magnetic coils are used both for levitation and propulsion. The trains are accelerated by alternating currents on the ground producing attraction and repulsion forces with the coils on the train. The levitation and guidance system, working with the same principle, ensures that the train is elevated and centered in the track. Rolling stock. On 2 December 2003, MLX01, a three-car train set a world record speed of 581 km/h (361 mph) in a manned run. On 16 November 2004, it also set a world record for two trains passing each other at a combined speed of 1,026 km/h (638 mph). On 26 October 2010, JR Central announced a new train type, the L0 Series, for commercial operation at 505 km/h (314 mph). It set a world record speed for a manned train of 603 km/h (375 mph) on 21 April 2015. On 26 March 2020, the Improved L0 Series started operations on the test track. It represents the completion of 80–90% of the design goals for the final train, and is the first to draw power from the track. Previous models used on-board gas generators."
1882070,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verrophone,Verrophone,"Abstract. A verrophone (""glass-euphonium"") is a musical instrument, invented in 1983 by Sascha Reckert, which, ""uses tuned glass tubes,"" open at one end and arranged in various sizes (usually in a chromatic scale, arranged from large to small, like the pipes of a pipe organ). The sound is made by rubbing one end of one or more of the glass tubes, or also by striking them or rubbing them with a special mallet. The tubes are close together so that chords can be played by rubbing more than one at the same time. The instrument carries more acoustical volume than the glass harmonica and some other glass instruments and generally has a range from G3 to F6 (which can be extended in the higher register with wine glasses, giving it a range up to D7). Every piece composed originally for glass harmonica can be played on the verrophone. Predecessors. The term verrophone originally referred to a glass harp. Previous glass instruments include the glass harmonica and arrangements of ordinary drinking glasses (approximately glass tubes closed at one end). The verrophone is capable of louder dynamics than the glass harp due to its larger radiating surfaces. Related instruments. Modern artists such as Barry Prophet of the Music Gallery have produced glass instruments that work similarly to a glockenspiel or lithophone, i.e. by striking various glass tubes. An example can be heard in a work entitled ""Crystal Bones"" composed and played on Prophet's microtonally tuned glass instruments. Notable players."
484563,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier,Cavalier,"Abstract. The term ""Cavalier "" (/ˌ k æ v ə ˈ l ɪər /) was first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642 – c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier. Etymology. Cavalier derives from the same Latin root as the Italian word cavaliere, the French word chevalier, and the Spanish word caballero, the Vulgar Latin word caballarius, meaning 'horseman'. Shakespeare used the word cavaleros to describe an overbearing swashbuckler or swaggering gallant in Henry IV, Part 2 (c. 1596–1599), in which Robert Shallow says ""I'll drink to Master Bardolph, and to all the cavaleros about London"". Shallow returns in The Merry Wives of Windsor (c. 1597), where he is called ""Cavaleiro Justice"" (knightly judge) and ""bully rook"", a term meaning ""blustering cheat"". Social perceptions. Cavalier was not understood at the time as primarily a term describing a style of dress, but a whole political and social attitude. However, in modern times the word has become more particularly associated with the court fashions of the period, which included long flowing hair in ringlets, brightly coloured clothing with elaborate trimmings (i.e., lace collars and cuffs), and plumed hats. This contrasted with the dress of at least the most extreme Roundhead supporters of Parliament, with their preference for shorter hair and plainer dress, although neither side conformed to the stereotypical images entirely. Most Parliamentarian generals wore their hair at much the same length as their Royalist counterparts, though Cromwell was something of an exception. The best patrons in the nobility of Charles I's court painter Sir Anthony van Dyck, the archetypal recorder of the Cavalier image, all took the Parliamentary side in the Civil War. Probably the most famous image identified as of a ""cavalier"", Frans Hals ' Laughing Cavalier, shows a gentleman from the strongly Calvinist Dutch town of Haarlem, and is dated 1624. These derogatory terms (for at the time they were so intended) also showed what the typical Parliamentarian thought of the Royalist side – capricious men who cared more for vanity than the nation at large. The chaplain to King Charles I, Edward Simmons described a Cavalier as ""a Child of Honour, a Gentleman well borne and bred, that loves his king for conscience sake, of a clearer countenance, and bolder look than other men, because of a more loyal Heart"". There were many men in the Royalist armies who fit this description since most of the Royalist field officers were typically in their early thirties, married with rural estates which had to be managed. Although they did not share the same outlook on how to worship God as the English Independents of the New Model Army, God was often central to their lives. This type of Cavalier was personified by Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading, whose prayer at the start of the Battle of Edgehill has become famous ""O Lord, Thou knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not forget me"". At the end of the First Civil War, Astley gave his word that he would not take up arms again against Parliament and having given his word he felt duty bound to refuse to help the Royalist cause in the Second Civil War; however, the word was coined by the Roundheads as a pejorative propaganda image of a licentious, hard drinking and frivolous man, who rarely, if ever, thought of God. It is this image which has survived and many Royalists, for example Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester, fitted this description to a tee. Of another Cavalier, George Goring, Lord Goring, a general in the Royalist army, the principal advisor to Charles II, Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, said: would, without hesitation, have broken any trust, or done any act of treachery to have satisfied an ordinary passion or appetite; and in truth wanted nothing but industry (for he had wit, and courage, and understanding and ambition, uncontrolled by any fear of God or man) to have been as eminent and successful in the highest attempt of wickedness as any man in the age he lived in or before. Of all his qualifications dissimulation was his masterpiece; in which he so much excelled, that men were not ordinarily ashamed, or out of countenance, with being deceived but twice by him. This sense has developed into the modern English use of ""cavalier"" to describe a recklessly nonchalant attitude, although still with a suggestion of stylishness. Cavalier remained in use as a description for members of the party that supported the monarchy up until the Exclusion Crisis of 1678–1681 when the term was superseded by ""Tory"" which was another term initially with pejorative connotations. Likewise, during the Exclusion Bill crisis, the term Roundhead was replaced with ""Whig "", a term introduced by the opponents of the Whigs and also was initially a pejorative term. In arts. An example of the Cavalier style can be seen in the painting Charles I, King of England, from Three Angles by Anthony van Dyck."

4688133,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_177,New York State Route 177,"Abstract. New York State Route 177 (NY 177) is an east–west state highway in the North Country of New York in the United States. It extends from Interstate 81 (I-81) exit 42 in the Jefferson County town of Adams to NY 12 west of the Lewis County village of Lowville. NY 177 intersects U.S. Route 11 (US 11) in Adams Center and meets Lewis County's County Route 21 (CR 21), formerly part of NY 194, at Barnes Corners. NY 177 originally began at US 11 when it was assigned in 1930. It was extended west to its present terminus in the 1950s following the construction of I-81. Route description. NY 177 begins at interchange 42 on I-81 in the town of Adams. The route progresses away from the interstate to the southeast, passing the former railroad station in Adams Center before intersecting with US 11 in the center of the hamlet. At this intersection, NY 177 turns eastward, leaving the populated hamlet for a rural backdrop and into the hamlet of Honeyville. Honeyville consists of little more than a few houses centered on the intersection of NY 177 and Fuller Road. After leaving Honeyville, NY 177 intersects with CR 155, where it turns to the southeast into the town of Rodman. After crossing a creek, the route enters the hamlet of Rodman as a two-lane road through the southern end of the hamlet. During the stretch around Rodman, NY 177 intersects with CR 85 (Creek Road) and CR 97 (Washington Park Road / School Street) before leaving the hamlet. NY 177 continues winding itself to the southeast through the town of Rodman, as a rural two-lane highway. After Williams Road, the route makes several bends in to the south and east, straightening out eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of CR 95. This eastward progression remains stagnant as NY 177 continues eastward past CR 189. After a short, empty stretch of roadway, NY 177 crosses the county line into Lewis County, where it enters the town of Pinckney. Through Pinckney, the route turns to the northeast, crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners. In Barnes Corners, the dense forest retreats for a rural community, where NY 177 intersects with CR 21 and CR 2 (Seven-by-Nine Road). CR 21 is the former southern terminus of NY 194, a designation eliminated in 1980. After leaving Barnes Corners, NY 177 returns to being the two-lane rural roadway, progressing southeastward through the town of Pinckney. Despite the rural scenery, the route does enter the hamlet of New Boston and the junction with CR 23 (Liberty Road). Passing a few farms, the route turns to the northeast near Mile Square Road, and enters the hamlet of Bellwood, within the town of Harrisburg. Bellwood consists of a few houses and an intersection with CR 27 and CR 28 (Sears Pond Road). Leaving Bellwood, NY 177 continues eastward into the hamlet of Windecker, which consists only of a few houses. Leaving Windecker, NY 177 bends to the southeast and enters the town of Lowville, passing a few farms and wind turbines before bending into the hamlet of West Lowville. In West Lowville, NY 177 intersects with NY 12, which continues eastward to the village of Lowville. NY 177 terminates at this intersection. History. NY 177 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally extended from US 11 in Adams Center to NY 12 west of the village of Lowville. When the portion of I-81 near Adams Center was completed in the late 1950s, NY 177 was extended westward over a county-maintained highway to meet the new expressway at exit 42. On August 1, 1979, ownership and maintenance of NY 177 between I-81 and US 11 was transferred from Jefferson County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government."

Louis Stokes Station at Windermere is a rapid transit station on the RTA Red Line in East Cleveland, Ohio. It is located on the northwest side of Euclid Avenue (U.S. Routes 6 and 20) between Bryn Mawr and Doan Roads. It is the eastern terminus of the Red Line and the HealthLine, a bus rapid transit route. History. Prior to being a rapid transit station, the site was the location of the Windermere Car Barn of the Cleveland Railway and its successor, the Cleveland Transit System (CTS). As streetcars were retired in favor of buses, Windermere also became a bus garage. On February 4, 1952, CTS broke ground for its rapid transit behind the Windermere Car Barn,on the same embankment as the Nickel Plate railway tracks. The new station, called simply ""Windermere Station,"" opened with the CTS Rapid Transit on March 15, 1955. As originally constructed, the station included on the embankment level a car yard and car shops for rapid transit and a loop to allow trains to turn around if needed (although the car sets all had operator cabs are both ends). On the south side below the tracks, there was a fare collection headhouse, three bus loading loops and a small free parking lot off Euclid Avenue, along with an elevated walkway over the bus loops to the Euclid Avenue parking lot. A pedestrian tunnel beneath the embankment carrying rapid transit and railway tracks connected the station to a larger free parking lot on the northwest side of the tracks. The entrance to the northwest parking lot was from Hayden Avenue. The Hayden bus garage was also built adjacent to the northwest lot to replace the Windermere Car Barn. The Windermere car shops were abandoned when RTA opened its new $23-million Central Rail Maintenance Facility opened on April 29, 1984, on a 20-acre (8.1 ha) site at East 55th Street. The Hayden parking lot also closed as the additional parking was not needed and most passengers perceived use of the tunnel as a security risk. The original station was demolished, and an entirely new station was constructed as part of RTA's program of station reconstruction beginning in the late 1990s. The new $12.7-million station opened on June 22, 1997. The turnaround loop and the car shops were eliminated. In November 1997, RTA renamed the station “Louis Stokes Station at Windermere” in honor of the Congressman Louis Stokes “for his many years of unwavering support.” In 1998, RTA completed a $21-million renovation of the Hayden bus garage. The property directly southwest of the Euclid Avenue parking area has been used for the construction of a Head Start Center, which was dedicated November 22, 2002. It was the first Head Start Center in Greater Cleveland built next to a rapid transit station, making the facility accessible for many of the families eligible for Head Start who do not have cars.

12552450,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superarchitettura,Superarchitettura,"Abstract. Superarchitettura is a theoretical & conceptual framework, whose physical definition has been given at the homonymous 1966 exhibition, held at Jolly2, an art gallery of Pistoia, Italy. According to the Radical Manifesto, ""Superarchitettura is the architecture of superproduction, superconsumption, superinduction to consume, the supermarket, the superman, super gas"". Superarchitettura is the overcoming of centuries of constant and consistent art vision. It is the overtaking of ancient artistic pratiques in favour of new avant-gardes, the Sixties so-called ""neo avant-gardes "". Superarchitettura's movement combined the inventiveness of Pop Art with the dynamics of mass production (for the latter, see its definition according to Mackintosh ' ideas and conceptions). Archizoom and Superstudio. The Superarchitettura theoretical framework, part of the Radical Design movement, after its beginning, got split up in two main philosophical entities and interpretations, the first incarnated by Archizoom Associati, the second by Superstudio. Archizoom and Superstudio held the Exhibition. Such event represented a milestone in the Italian Radical Design. According to the first group (to which belonged ""free thinkers"" -architects and designers- like Andrea Branzi, Gilberto Corretti, Paolo Deganello, Massimo Morozzi, Dario Bartolini and Lucia Bartolini), in order to get away from Tradition, men must overturn conventions and exalt everything kitsch as a statement of aesthetic and ideological challenge. On the other side, according to the second group (to which belonged Adolfo Natalini, Cristiano Toraldo di Francia, Piero Frassinelli, Alessandro Magris and Roberto Magris), to run away from Tradition, a new architecture must be imagined and created, which must be based on rejecting the impositions of production in favour of symbolic, dreamy values, which can ideologically fit into the landscape. Anti-Design as the Sinthesis. These two philosophical interpretations of the Radical Design being conceivable as Socrates ' ""Thesis "" and ""Antithesis "", its overcoming brought to a very peculiar ""Synthesis "". Such was the Anti-Design framework, son of such dispute. Archizoom in particular is today considered the initiator of Anti-Design. Its members questioned from the ground the traditional status-function and basic-nature of design, as well as that of the architectural production."

4895134,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country_Carnival,West Country Carnival,"Abstract. The West Country Carnival Circuits are an annual celebration featuring a parade of illuminated carts in the English West Country. The celebration dates back to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The purpose is to raise money for local charities. The series of parades in each town now form a major regional festival. Some carts cost in excess of £40,000 to build and are the result of thousands of hours work throughout the year. History. The timing of the West Country Carnival close to the British celebration of Bonfire Night on 5 November is no coincidence, as the roots of the original carnival in Bridgwater date back to 1605. Guy Fawkes is the character most associated with the plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament, however the instigator was Jesuit priest Robert Parsons from Nether Stowey, a short distance from Bridgwater. Parsons and his colleagues Edmund Campion and Ralph Emerson were Catholics, who wanted to put an end to the Protestant monarchy and parliament of the day, in order to put an end to Catholic persecution. In 1580, they were discovered attempting to garner favour with northern-English based nobility in the English Mission, and were then associated with the failed Spanish Armada of 1588, both plots to replace Protestant Elizabeth I of England with catholic Mary Queen of Scots. After the execution of Campion and natural death of Emerson, Parsons continued to plot to restore Catholic power in England, and hence his last ill-fated attempt against parliament and King James VI on 5 November 1605. After the failure of the Gunpowder Plot, Parsons was key in corresponding with Thomas Morton over the authority of use of St Paul in the creation and implementation of the Jacobean Oath of Allegiance Bonfire night is a major annual celebration across the whole of England, but it is likely that the reason that the West Country Carnival was originally so keenly celebrated is that the South West towns were predominantly Protestant – hence the celebration of Robert Parsons' (and Guy Fawkes') failure. The religious origins of the event are almost forgotten and far less significant today. Bridgwater. The original Bridgwater celebrations consisted of a large bonfire at the Cornhill. Built out of a large wooden boat, around one hundred tar barrels were added, together with just about anything else available which could be burned. This tradition was stopped due to lack of old wooden boats to burn, and because a number of good boats were thrown onto the fire and burnt by over-enthusiastic revellers. Effigies or ""guys"" representing the gunpowder plot instigators were added to the fire by local groups of people known as gangs. It would seem it was these gangs who started the trend towards a procession, as they paraded their guys towards the bonfire. As years passed by, the tradition was continued and the annual celebration became more and more elaborate, involving costumes, and music, until the key feature of the event was a large carnival procession. The local people who dressed up and took part in the event were known as Masqueraders or Features - terms still used today to describe the parade participants. There were no parades during the Second World War, but a local carnival enthusiast William Henry Edwin Lockyer also known as ""Nosey"" walked the carnival route for six years with a group known as The Kilties, to keep the tradition alive. In 2020 and 2021, the procession featuring carts was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, to replace the 2020 Bridgwater procession a live stream was held on carnival night showing some of the best carnival carts over the years. In 2021, smaller Masquerade parades were put on in Bridgwater and Burnhum-On-Sea, which featured most of the clubs in the previous years carnivals, enter with walking entries on a smaller route. Carnival circuit. The Bridgwater carnival was the first carnival of its type, however other carnival processions within the South West began some years ago. They start in late August and continue until late November. The oldest and largest circuit is the Somerset County Guy Fawkes Carnival Association Circuit which starts at Bridgwater, with many of the carts will appear in all of the carnivals. Prizes are awarded in several categories for the best carts in each carnival. The four circuits are: There is one unofficial carnival in the circuit, held at Midsomer Norton. There is also a series of individual carnivals not part of any circuit, including Blandford Forum, Melksham, South Brent, South Petherton. In 2020, all the carnival circuits were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Carts and floats. Uniquely in the West Country, the vehicles are called carts, unlike other carnivals where the term carnival float is used. The term cart is still used today to describe the large and elaborate trailers used in the procession. Carts are built by local clubs of individuals funded totally by charitable donations and sponsorship from local businesses. Carts are always themed, with no restriction on the theme from the organising committee. Regularly chosen themes include: Carts include both music and costumed people to complete their theme. People and items on the cart can either be moving or static in tableau. Today these carts are driven by farm tractors or trucks, and usually also tow a large diesel-driven electricity generator to provide the huge amount of power required to power the carts. Some generators used can provide over one megawatt of power, with 10,000 to 30,000 lamps not uncommon on a modern-day cart. The towing vehicles themselves are often decorated to match the rest of the cart and generator, and in some cases modified so that the driver is positioned low down between the two front wheels. This allows for a higher degree of decoration without obscuring the driver's view. The length of the entire cart is often built to the maximum allowable of 100 feet (30 m). These carts are interspersed with walking exhibits known as masqueraders, either groups or singles, occasional marching bands or majorette troupes, and charity collectors who take donations from the spectators. Carnival clubs. Carts or floats are built by local clubs (CC), which as local charities themselves are aimed specifically and solely at raising funds for other charities which operate within their locality. Clubs generate all funds required to build and operate their carts totally by charitable donations from individuals and sponsorship from local businesses — all funds raised during the carnival season are wholly distributed by the club charity. Some carts cost in excess of £20,000 to build and are the result of thousands of man-hours work throughout the year. Most clubs are based around local working or social circles, such as pubs and clubs. Many clubs have specialist Juvenile Carnival clubs (JCC) for the under 16s. To join an adult 16 and over club, an initiation ceremony is often involved. All work is carried out in the spare time of the club members on a voluntary basis – often working all night in the final few days to get carts ready."

2601222,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodie_landing_system,Brodie landing system,"Abstract. The Brodie landing system was a unique method of launching and landing light aircraft that was devised by Captain James H. Brodie, a member of the Transportation Corps who was later transferred to the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. The novel system involved catching an overhead hook attached to the plane with a sling, which itself was attached to a cable secured between towers and acted as an arresting gear. This system was originally envisioned to provide anti-submarine aircraft support for trans-Atlantic convoys, and for operating lightweight liaison aircraft in terrain normally unsuitable for runway construction, such as dense jungle or in the mountains. However, it was never employed in those environments due to its late adoption in the war. One of its perceived land-based qualities was that its small size would render it much harder to detect by the enemy than a conventional landing strip. After a successful demonstration at Moisant Field (now New Orleans International Airport), the system was tested in September 1943 for shipboard use when it was installed on the motor ship City of Dalhart. Staff Sergeant R. A. Gregory performed ten successful takeoffs and hookups without incident with a Stinson L-5 Sentinel, but those operations were conducted under ideal weather and sea conditions. The Brodie device was designed to allowed cargo vessels to be inexpensively converted with relatively minor structural changes so that they could launch and recover planes at sea. The system was used by the Navy for launching Marine Corps OY-1 Sentinels (a Navy version of the L-5) at Iwo Jima and Army Piper L-4 Cubs at Okinawa from LST-776. While the invention achieved moderate success, several OY-1's were lost due to pitching and rolling of the ship at sea. Concluding that the device was better suited for fixed installations on land, the Navy program was terminated in favor of CVE escort aircraft carriers that were allocated to carry liaison planes during the planned invasion of Japan. Brodie and test pilot Flight Officer Raymond Gregory were awarded the Legion of Merit for their work on the system in 1945. Brodie envisioned scaling the system up to capture planes as heavy as 7000 lbs. He was issued US Patent # 2,435,197, # 2,488,050, # 2,488,051, # 3,163,380 for variations of the landing system.

58077181,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUTYH-associated_polyposis,MUTYH-associated polyposis,"Abstract. MUTYH-associated polyposis (also known as MYH-associated polyposis) is an autosomal recessive polyposis syndrome. The disorder is caused by mutations in both alleles (genetic copies) of the DNA repair gene, MUTYH. The MUTYH gene encodes a base excision repair protein, which corrects oxidative damage to DNA. Affected individuals have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, precancerous colon polyps (adenomas) and an increased risk of several additional cancers. About 1–2 percent of the population possess a mutated copy of the MUTYH gene, and less than 1 percent of people have the MUTYH associated polyposis syndrome. The presence of 10 or more colon adenomas should prompt consideration of MUTYH-associated polyposis, familial adenomatous polyposis and similar syndromes. Pathophysiology. MUTYH-associated polyposis is caused by a mutation of the MUTYH gene, which is located on chromosome 1. The condition may be caused by identical mutations affecting both copies of the gene (biallelic mutations) or where each allele is affected by different mutations (compound heterozygote). Treatment. Treatment is similar to familial adenomatous polyposis, which varies based on the extent of polyps. All first degree relatives of individuals with the condition should undergo screening for MUTYH associated polyposis. To identify risk for future offspring, screening should be offered to spouses of individuals affected by MUTYH associated polyposis. If the spouse is a carrier of a mutation in MUTYH, then genetic counseling should be offered to the children as they approach adulthood. Epidemiology. Without surveillance or screening, between 43% and 100% of individuals with MUTYH-associated polyposis develop colorectal cancer."

1512733,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhelum,Jhelum,"Abstract. Jhelum (/ˈ dʒ eɪ l ə m /; جہلم; Punjabi:; Urdu:) is a city on the East Bank of the Jhelum River, which is located in the district of Jhelum in the North of Punjab, Pakistan. It is the 44th largest city of Pakistan by population. Jhelum is known for providing many soldiers to the British Army before independence, and later to the Pakistan armed forces, due to which it is also known as City of Soldiers or Land of Martyrs and Warriors. Jhelum is a few miles upstream from the site of the ancient Battle of the Hydaspes between the armies of Alexander and King Porus. Possibly Jhelum City was the capital of Porus' Kingdom, Paurava. A city called Bucephala was founded nearby to commemorate the death of Alexander's horse, Bucephalus. Other notable sites nearby include the 16th-century Rohtas Fort, the Tilla Jogian complex of ancient temples, and the 16th-century Grand Trunk Road which passes through the city. According to the 2017 census of Pakistan, the population of Jhelum was 190,425. The name of the city is derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow), as the water that flows through the river originates in the Himalayas. There are a number of industries in and around Jhelum city, including a tobacco factory, wood, marble, glass and flour mills. Its near the capital of Pakistan. Etymology. Anjum Sultan Shahbaz recorded some stories of the name Jhelum in his book Tareekh-e-Jhelum as: Many writers have different opinions about the name of Jhelum. One suggestion is that in ancient days Jhelumabad was known as Jalham. The word Jhelum is reportedly derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow). The name thus refers to the waters of a river (flowing besides the city) which have their origins in the snow-capped Himalayas. However, some writers believe that when ""Dara-e-Azam"" reached a certain place on the river bank after winning many battles, he fixed his flag at that place and called it ""Ja-e-Alam"" which means ""Place of the Flag"". With the passage of time it became Jhelum from ""Ja-e-Alam"". According to tradition, Saeed Bin Abi Waqas, brother of Saad Bin Abi Waqas, was sent to China to preach Islam, during his journey he arrived at the city of Jhelum, he saw the reflection of a city in the river and said ""هذا جهيلم "" (this is Jhelum), which means ""City besides the river, in full moonlight"". Ahmed Shah Abdali also used ""Jheelum"" in place of Jhelum and ""Harian"" for Kharian in his diary. History. Administration. As well as being district capital, Jhelum city is also the headquarters of Jhelum Tehsil, the city of Jhelum is administratively subdivided into seven union councils: Jhelum-I, Jhelum-II, Jhelum-III, Jhelum-IV, Jhelum-V, Jhelum-VI and Jhelum-VII. Demography. The population of the Jhelum city is about 188,800 (2012) and it is the 32nd largest city of Pakistan with respect to population. Total area of city is about 22 km (8.5 sq mi). Population density is 261/km. Population growth rate is 1.51 which is very low as compared to other urban areas of Pakistan. The majority of the population i.e. 98.47 percent is Muslim. Among the minorities Christians are in the majority sharing 1.36 percent in the district. The literacy rate of Jhelum is among the highest in Pakistan. At 79%, it is only lower than that of Islamabad and neighbouring Rawalpindi. Somewhat higher than the literacy in Punjab province (58 percent). The literacy rate has remarkably increased from 38.9 percent in 1981. The rate is much higher in the urban areas for both males and females. 84% of the population have electricity and 96% have access to water. Human Development Index of Jhelum is 0.770, which is highest in Pakistan after Karachi. Geography and climate. Lying at 32°56′ North latitude and 73°44′ East longitude, Jhelum is located a 1-hour and 30 minutes drive from the Capital of Pakistan Islamabad, and 3 hours drive from the heart of Punjab Lahore. Jhelum is linked with these cities through the National Highway N-5. Several cities are within 1 to 2 hours drive including Gujrat (home to fan manufacturing), Gujranwala, Chakwal and Mirpur, Azad Kashmir. Jhelum has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa) and is extremely hot and humid in summer, and cold and generally dry in winter. The maximum recorded temperature in the pre-monsoon season of April to June is 49.2 °C (120.6 °F), whereas in winter the minimum temperature recorded is −0.6 °C (30.9 °F). Average annual rainfall is about 850 millimetres (33 in) which is much below the required quantity given the extremely high evaporation levels. Nevertheless, in the rainy season water torrents flow from the north to the Jhelum River very rapidly and cause damage to the crops, bridges, roads. This is responsible for the soil erosion in the district. Over the years, global climate change has affected Jhelum as well as any other place on Earth and below comparison charts from Weatherbase and NOAA show the difference in rainfall between 1990 and 2015: Important sites. Rohtas Fort is a garrison fort built by the great Afghan king Sher Shah Suri. This fort is about 4 km in circumference. Qila Rohtas is situated in a gorge approximately 18 km NW of Jhelum and 7 km from Dina. The old city has a labyrinth of narrow streets and bazaars. Opposite the CMH Jhelum Cantt is located the CMH Masjid Jhelum mosque. Located in the cantonment area is the St. John's Church Jhelum which was built in 1860. There was a local stadium near Gul Afshan Colony which was changed to a cricket stadium named Zamir Jaffri Cricket Stadium. Altaf Park which was constructed in 1994–95 is in a very close proximity of Cricket Stadium. Nearly 100 m from Shandar Chowk, in the center of city, is Major Akram Shaheed Memorial Park. Major Muhammad Akram Memorial Library is also present in this park. This is also a site of a parade which takes place every year on 6 September at the occasion of Defence Day. Lehri Nature Park is located 10 kilometers away from G. T. Road between Jhelum and Islamabad, it is 30 kilometers from Jhelum and 90 kilometers from Islamabad in the hilly Pothohar region. The Mangla Dam is located on the Jhelum River about 30 km (19 mi) from Jhelum, it is the twelfth largest dam in the world. It was constructed in 1967 across the Jhelum River. There is the Mangla View Resort that is the first planned resort development in Pakistan to offer residences, villas, townhouses, hotels, serviced apartments and retail outlets. The resort is located on a 340-acre (1.4 km2) site on the Mangla Dam area. Rasul Barrage is located on the Jhelum River about 30 km downstream from Jhelum. Two major water canals originate at the Rasul barrage, Rasul-Qadirabad link canal which is also called Lower-Jhelum link canal and Rasul-Shahpur branch canal. The area around the Rasul Barrage lake is also a picnic spot. Travel and tourism. Auto Rickshaws are a common mode of transport for short routes within the city. Many of the new rickshaws in the city use Compressed natural gas (CNG) instead of the petrol engines as CNG is environmentally clean and cheaper than petrol. Rickshaws are another important mode of transportation. The older horse drawn tongas are now defunct although some can still be privately commissioned. Taxis and privately commissioned small passenger carrying vans are available. Daewoo Express Bus Service and other bus services operate from the city to the entire country. The Jhelum Railway Station was built in 1928 during British rule before the independence of Pakistan. It was connected by the North-Western Railway to other cities in the Indian empire. Jhelum is on main line of Pakistan Railways, and linked to whole country through Railway line across Pakistan. The nearest international airport is the Islamabad International Airport, which is approximately 110 km by road from Jhelum. The Sialkot International Airport, is approximately 100 km by road from Jhelum. A small airport called Gurha Salim Airport is situated 13 km (8 mi) from the city centre. It is not being used by any commercial airlines, but only for military purposes. Sports. Located within the city is a golf course called the River-View Golf Club, where national golf tournaments are held regularly. There is a cricket and football stadium, Zamir Jaffri Cricket Stadium, where district level tournaments are held. In October 2008, Pakistan Cricket Board upgraded this stadium for regional events. Education. Jhelum has six degree colleges for women, six degree colleges for men, six co-education colleges, six commerce colleges, one law college, numerous higher secondary schools and over 150 high schools. It also has a campus Of Punjab University, Punjab University Jhelum Campus, near Rathiyan, Kala Gujran and Satellite Town Jhelum. The University of the Punjab has established a campus in Jhelum offering programs related to business, commerce, law, and computer science. The new undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs are due to commence soon. The literacy rate of Jhelum is high in comparison to other cities of the Punjab. 65 kanals of land was allocated to establish this campus by Government of Punjab. Jhelum also has two sub-campuses of the Virtual University of Pakistan, Virtual University Campus at Civil Lines opposite city Church, and a private virtual campus, Wings Institute of Learning. Virtual University of Pakistan inaugurated its own Campus in Jhelum in March 2012; VU Jhelum Campus is located in the middle of the city."

Moorhouse's aptitude for rendering dialogue is as keen as ever, especially with conversations in which grog is involved as subject or succour. His rambling digressions are again wry and artful; in Forty-Seventeen, Moorhouse regales us with observations on camping, conferences, sluttishness, and the Spanish Civil War, as well as the hardy perennial of drinking...But the book really lacks much discipline or development. Or, as Moorhouse remarks of a more carnal passion, 'it is a love without definition but not without art'. Lack of definition connotes lack of clarity and lack of force.""

We name this dismay the mid-life crisis; a detonation like a star-shell that bathes the hilltop vantage in dead-white light. Forty-Seventeen by the Australian novelist Frank Moorhouse is about one man's view from his shell-lit hill.

103356,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory,Automata theory,"Abstract. Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science with close connections to mathematical logic. The word automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματος, which means ""self-acting, self-willed, self-moving"". An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a Finite Automaton (FA) or Finite-State Machine (FSM). The figure on the right illustrates a finite-state machine, which is a well-known type of automaton. This automaton consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows). As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function, which takes the previous state and current input symbol as its arguments. Automata theory is closely related to formal language theory. In this context, automata are used as finite representations of formal languages that may be infinite. Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, as in the Chomsky hierarchy, which describes a nesting relationship between major classes of automata. Automata play a major role in the theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification. History. The theory of abstract automata was developed in the mid-20th century in connection with finite automata. Automata theory was initially considered a branch of mathematical systems theory, studying the behavior of discrete-parameter systems. Early work in automata theory differed from previous work on systems by using abstract algebra to describe information systems rather than differential calculus to describe material systems. The theory of the finite-state transducer was developed under different names by different research communities. The earlier concept of Turing machine was also included in the discipline along with new forms of infinite-state automata, such as pushdown automata. 1956 saw the publication of Automata Studies, which collected work by scientists including Claude Shannon, W. Ross Ashby, John von Neumann, Marvin Minsky, Edward F. Moore, and Stephen Cole Kleene. With the publication of this volume, ""automata theory emerged as a relatively autonomous discipline"". The book included Kleene's description of the set of regular events, or regular languages, and a relatively stable measure of complexity in Turing machine programs by Shannon. In the same year, Noam Chomsky described the Chomsky hierarchy, a correspondence between automata and formal grammars, and Ross Ashby published An Introduction to Cybernetics, an accessible textbook explaining automata and information using basic set theory. The study of linear bounded automata led to the Myhill–Nerode theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a formal language to be regular, and an exact count of the number of states in a minimal machine for the language. The pumping lemma for regular languages, also useful in regularity proofs, was proven in this period by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott, along with the computational equivalence of deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata. In the 1960s, a body of algebraic results known as ""structure theory"" or ""algebraic decomposition theory"" emerged, which dealt with the realization of sequential machines from smaller machines by interconnection. While any finite automaton can be simulated using a universal gate set, this requires that the simulating circuit contain loops of arbitrary complexity. Structure theory deals with the ""loop-free"" realizability of machines.The theory of computational complexity also took shape in the 1960s. By the end of the decade, automata theory came to be seen as ""the pure mathematics of computer science"". Automata. What follows is a general definition of an automaton, which restricts a broader definition of a system to one viewed as acting in discrete time-steps, with its state behavior and outputs defined at each step by unchanging functions of only its state and input. Variant definitions of automata. Automata are defined to study useful machines under mathematical formalism. So the definition of an automaton is open to variations according to the ""real world machine"" that we want to model using the automaton. People have studied many variations of automata. The following are some popular variations in the definition of different components of automata. Different combinations of the above variations produce many classes of automata. Automata theory is a subject matter that studies properties of various types of automata. For example, the following questions are studied about a given type of automata. Automata theory also studies the existence or nonexistence of any effective algorithms to solve problems similar to the following list: Types of automata. The following is an incomplete list of types of automata. Hierarchy in terms of powers. The following is an incomplete hierarchy in terms of powers of different types of virtual machines. The hierarchy reflects the nested categories of languages the machines are able to accept. Applications. Each model in automata theory plays important roles in several applied areas. Finite automata are used in text processing, compilers, and hardware design. Context-free grammar (CFGs) are used in programming languages and artificial intelligence. Originally, CFGs were used in the study of human languages. Cellular automata are used in the field of artificial life, the most famous example being John Conway 's Game of Life. Some other examples which could be explained using automata theory in biology include mollusk and pine cone growth and pigmentation patterns. Going further, a theory suggesting that the whole universe is computed by some sort of a discrete automaton, is advocated by some scientists. The idea originated in the work of Konrad Zuse, and was popularized in America by Edward Fredkin. Automata also appear in the theory of finite fields: the set of irreducible polynomials that can be written as composition of degree two polynomials is in fact a regular language.Another problem for which automata can be used is the induction of regular languages. Automata simulators. Automata simulators are pedagogical tools used to teach, learn and research automata theory. An automata simulator takes as input the description of an automaton and then simulates its working for an arbitrary input string. The description of the automaton can be entered in several ways. An automaton can be defined in a symbolic language or its specification may be entered in a predesigned form or its transition diagram may be drawn by clicking and dragging the mouse. Well known automata simulators include Turing's World, JFLAP, VAS, TAGS and SimStudio. Connection to category theory. One can define several distinct categories of automata following the automata classification into different types described in the previous section. The mathematical category of deterministic automata, sequential machines or sequential automata, and Turing machines with automata homomorphisms defining the arrows between automata is a Cartesian closed category, it has both categorical limits and colimits. An automata homomorphism maps a quintuple of an automaton A onto the quintuple of another automaton A. Automata homomorphisms can also be considered as automata transformations or as semigroup homomorphisms, when the state space, S, of the automaton is defined as a semigroup S. Monoids are also considered as a suitable setting for automata in monoidal categories. One could also define a variable automaton, in the sense of Norbert Wiener in his book on The Human Use of Human Beings via the endomorphisms A i → A i {\displaystyle A_{i}\to A_{i}}. Then one can show that such variable automata homomorphisms form a mathematical group. In the case of non-deterministic, or other complex kinds of automata, the latter set of endomorphisms may become, however, a variable automaton groupoid. Therefore, in the most general case, categories of variable automata of any kind are categories of groupoids or groupoid categories. Moreover, the category of reversible automata is then a 2-category, and also a subcategory of the 2-category of groupoids, or the groupoid category."

The monastery of Mohill-Manchan (Irish: mainistir an Maothail-Manachain) was anciently located at Mohill, in county Leitrim. The earliest church was founded by Manchán of Mohill in the 6th century. Little is known about the former monastic community here. About the year 1216, the monastery became a religious house of the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine dedicated to the Saint Mary until suppression c. 1550 – c. 1590. The Priory of Mohill was briefly revived during Confederate Ireland rule but suppressed again by Cromwellian forces c. 1649–1653. From the ruins St. Mary's Church, Mohill, of Protestant denomination, was established in the 18th century. Monastery. The former monastic settlement of Mohill was one of a multitude of monasteries that sprang up during 6th century Ireland. A Christian missionary named Manchan founded a church here between 500–38 AD. Whether or not Manchan died at Mohill is unknown, though his remains may have been preserved and enshrined here. Nothing is known of the monastic community at Mohill, but it surely consisted of a church, school, mill, house of hospitality, Christian burial ground, monastic cells, ""house of tears"", and a round tower. The monastery was governed by the bishop, abbot, and a uniquely Irish ""erenagh "", power being exercised by one person, or perhaps combined in practical permutations. It was strongly bound to the túath of Muintir Eolais, allowing the Bishop little influence; the lifestyle followed asceticism. The monastery of Mohill was of considerable extent stretching across the river to encompass the townlands of Mohill, Tullybradan, Lisdadanan, coolabaun, Cappagh, Gortfadda, Drumcroy and Drumkilla, an estate of c. 300 – c. 600 acres. A daughter church at Cloonmorris was founded c. 500–700 AD. Priory. From the 13th century (c. 1216) following a reform movement of the Irish church, the monastery became the Priory of Saint Mary 's of Mohill-Manchan. The priory belonged in the diocese of Ardagh, with Canons regular adhering to the Rule of St. Augustine. The Priory of St. Mary's was headed by a prior, their office being valued at 20 ""marks sterling "" c. 1400 – c. 1401, or ""10–20 marks sterling"" in the 15th century. In 1418 the Priory of St. Mary's at Mohill was described as ""conventual, with cure "", and a dependency of the priory of Abbeyshrule in Ardagh diocese, and sufficiently attractive for a canon from Clonmacnoise to enter its doors. In 1475, the Priory of St. Mary's Mohill was described as ""conventual"", ""elective"", ""with cure"", whose value did not exceed c. ""12 marks"", and ""not depending on any other monastery or place"", though a petition dated 1477 again alleged the dependency existed First suppression, 1560-90. From 1540 the English were forcefully suppressing Monasteries throughout Ireland, and ""the end of the sixteenth century a bad time for priests and papists "". Some sources suggest the monastery was suppressed as late as 1621, however Mohill was described as the ""Queens's manor"" consisting of 'about six quarters' in as 1583, and in 1590 ""an immense"" english army occupied Mohill and routed the ""Muintir Eolais"" chieftains. The ""late monastery of Moghill"" was divided between Edward Barrett c. 1592, and Terence O'Byrne of Muintir Eolais c. 1594. Barret's parcel subsequently passing to an englishman named John Crofton c. 1594, who bequeathed same to his son Henry by a deed dated 2 June 1607. On dissolution the Priory possessions were the townlands of Tullybradan, Coolabaun, Gortfadda, and Drumcroy, totaling c. 160 – c. 240 acres, a church, two stone buildings, and the cemetery. ""near the end of the sixteenth century. A bad time it was for priests and papists"" John O'Hart, Irish pedigrees, 1892, page 414. Revival. Confederate Ireland rule was established c. 1642 – c. 1649, and during the Eleven Years' War the ""Priory of Mohill "" was re-established in some manner. Ecclesiastical documents record Canon Antony Mag Raghnaill, otherwise Reynolds, being appointed Prior of Maothail-Manchain on 21 August 1648. Final suppression, 1649–1653. The Priory was suppressed again during devastating Cromwellian conquest of Ireland c. 1649 – c. 1653. Heritage. Priory clergy were expelled and risked execution under the Penal Laws. In 1666 four Reynolds priests (James, Loghlin, Richard, Walter) are among ""forty nine Catholics from hiding places in the woods"" in county Roscommon, who signed a letter in support of the Pope and protesting the loss of their 'due liberties'. And in 1713 an elderly Father Connor Reynolds ""of Jamestown in the county of Leitrim"" who had been exiled in Spain since 1681, was captured hiding in a trunk on a fishing boat arriving at Dungarvan port and imprisoned at Waterford gaol. Today nothing survives of the early ecclesiastical site here, except for an inaccessible old school-house, and the base of a round tower located near the old persons home in the town. The remains of the abbey or sanctuary forms the south, and east, walls of the Hyde family vault in the graveyard of 'Saint Mary's church' later built on the Priory ruins. The Croftons also built an old Castle at Rinn Lough from the ruins of Mohill Priory, as small free stones of the same class were evidenced in each. There may be other undocumented ruins on the wider monastic site, though it's not classed as a national monument or heritage site."

1795164,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regium_Donum,Regium Donum,"Abstract. The Regium Donum (Latin: ""Royal Bounty"") in British history was an annual grant to augment the income of poor Nonconformist clergy. There were separate grants for English Dissenters and for Irish Presbyterian clergy. The money originally came from the monarch's privy purse as an ex gratia donation, but it later became an annual grant voted by Parliament. The Irish Regium Donum originated in a grant of £1,200 pa to Presbyterian clergy in the north of Ireland made by William III in 1690 as a reward for the loyalty of Presbyterians during the war in Ireland following the Glorious Revolution. Queen Anne, when instituting ""Queen Anne's Bounty "" to augment poor Anglican livings, also added another £800 pa to assist Presbyterian clergy in the rest of Ireland (an offer of similar assistance to English Dissenting Ministers was declined). The Irish Church Act 1869, whose main purpose was to disestablish the Anglican Church of Ireland, also discontinued the Irish Regium Donum (and the grant to the Roman Catholic St Patrick's College, Maynooth) from 1871; existing ministers continued to receive equivalent payment from the Church Temporalities Commission. The English Regium Donum was instituted in 1723, originally £500 pa to allow the payment of pensions of widows of Dissenting Ministers, but later increased to £1,000 pa to also cover augmentation of income of living ministers. From Charles II onwards, there had been earlier royal donations to Dissenting clergymen, but political motives were suspected, and a proposed grant of £1,000 pa by Queen Anne was declined. The Regium Donum was originally not publicised, and one eighteenth-century critic saw it as a secret bribe to Dissenters to support Sir Robert Walpole and to buy off any agitation against the civil disabilities of Dissenters (e.g. the Test and Corporation Acts). Reform of royal finances by Pitt the Younger resulted in the Regium Donum becoming a grant voted by Parliament, rather than a charge upon the Civil List. In principle, this changed it from an ex gratia payment to a forced donation by taxpayers (including those opposed to the religious views of those supported): the Regium Donum was therefore henceforth opposed (on the grounds of consistency) by some advocates of the disestablishment of the Church of England. There was growing opposition by organised Dissent; because of this, the government announced in 1851 that the Regium Donum would not be voted in subsequent years."

The channel cuts across Long Sand. In the west it opens onto the nominal cut-off point of Knock Deep (north) or the Princes Channel (south) which links to the Strait of Dover. In the west it opens to Black Deep, a Thames approach. Fisherman's Gat was opened up to shipping as a route through, consequent to the demise of North Edinburgh Channel as a buoyed route. Opened in 2000 with a controlling depth of 7.4 metres, the navigation depth has since increased to 8.3 metres (January 2006). The gat in 1934 had minimum depth of 19 feet (5.8 m), naturally greater around its due east access but much less next to the north-west, its narrows/neck. Shipping generally approaches Fisherman's Gat from an arc, extending from south of Kentish Knock to the far east, around to North East Spit buoy to the south-southeast. For vessels approaching the Thames Estuary from the south or east, it makes a saving of 20 miles (32 km) and lower pilot charges when compared with the Sunk route to the north. As time passes it is becoming a more dominant use by moderate draft vessels (save those heralding from the north/middle of the North Sea), some of which are still being routed via the Sunk (north end of Black Deep)."
18791053,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Livery_Stable,Old Livery Stable,"Abstract. The Old Livery Stable in Fountain, Colorado is a historic stable which was built in 1893 as part of a small hotel complex. It housed horses of hotel guests. With the rise of automobiles such use ended and the stable decayed. The hotel was damaged in a fire in the 1940s, then partially repaired to serve as a rooming house, then demolished to make way for new buildings; only the stable remains. Its NRHP nomination states that the stable is: a vestige of the life and commerce of an earlier day in Fountain. Although vernacular in style, the architecture is of particular interest. The thick, heavy walls; the use of crude stones; the massiveness of the construction; and the integrated use of the dormer and cupola in a stable all reflect a time and a place where there was relatively little architectural knowledge, a time and a place where the builders drew on their rough experiences to build a utilitarian structure to serve the hotel trade. Today the Old Livery Stable stands as a landmark in downtown Fountain."

Dellwood Reservoir is a reservoir in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan in the Rural Municipality of Usborne No. 310. The reservoir was built along the course of Dellwood Brook as part of South Saskatchewan River Project. That project, originating at Gardiner Dam of Lake Diefenbaker, involved the building of aqueducts and a series of reservoirs to supply water for irrigation, consumption, and industry. The reservoir is about 22 kilometres (14 mi) north-east of the town of Watrous and access is from Highway 668. Description. Dellwood Reservoir is the terminal, or final, reservoir in the Saskatoon Southeast Water Supply System (SSEWSS) that originates at Lake Diefenbaker. The other reservoirs upstream in the system include Broderick Reservoir, Brightwater Reservoir, Indi Lake, Blackstrap Lake, Bradwell Reservoir, and Zelma Reservoir. Dellwood Reservoir supplies water to the Nutrien Lanigan Potash mine and the communities of Guernsey and Lanigan. Besides the canal, the other significant inflow is Dellwood Brook. Dellwood Brook originates north of the reservoir and flows south into the north end. The canal flows into the east side of the reservoir.

45644368,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Through_Law_Association,Peace Through Law Association,"Abstract. The Peace Through Law Association (French: APD: Association de la paix par le droit) was a French pacifist organization active in the years before World War I (1914–1918) that continued to promote its cause throughout the inter-war period leading up to World War II (1939–1945). For many years it was the leading organization of the fragmented French pacifist movement. The APD believed that peace could be maintained through an internationally agreed legal framework, with mediation to resolve disputes. It did not support individual conscientious objection, which it thought was ineffective. It would not align with the left-wing ""peace at all costs"" groups, or with the right-wing groups that thought the League of Nations was all that was needed. Background. Several pacifist organizations were active in France in the late 19th century and early 20th century.The French Society for Arbitration Between Nations (Société française pour l’arbitrage entre les nations) was founded by Frédéric Passy (1822–1912), who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901.The International League for Peace and Freedom (LIPL: Ligue internationale de la paix et de la liberté) was founded in Geneva in 1867 and was chaired by Charles Lemonnier (1860–1930).The LIPL was based in Switzerland until 1919, but had a Paris committee headed by Émile Arnaud (1864–1921), who became president of the League in 1891.The League published a monthly journal, Les États-Unis d’Europe (The United States of Europe). Foundation. Louis Barnier, who founded the organization, met the English Quaker and leader of the Wisbech Local Peace Society Priscilla Hannah Peckover (1833–1931) while he was a student in England.From the Quakers he became converted to the concept of peace through arbitration. On his return he shared this new faith with his teenage friends in Nîmes. They formed a focus group called ""The Wave"" (la Gerbe).The association was founded on 7 April 1887 by six students led by Théodore Eugène César Ruyssen (1868–1967).At first it was named the Association of Young Friends of Peace (Association des jeunes amis de la paix).It was Protestant in nature, influenced by utopian socialism and by the cooperative school of Nîmes, which reflected the ideas of Charles Gide (1847–1932), Emmanuel de Boyve and Auguste Marie Fabre (1833–1922). Fabre was particularly influential on the young peace activists. Early years. At first the association reflected the reforming Huguenot origins of most of the members, but soon developed more legalistic, internationalist and positivist views.The group denounced military service, and Barnier left France rather than accept enlistment, but eventually the others moved to a less radical position.In 1895 the association took the name of Peace Through Law Association (APD: Association de la paix par le droit).The APD stated that its purpose was to ""study and popularize the juridicial solutions for international conflicts and particularly to gain support for this position by the activity of young persons without distinction of sex.The early members of the student group such as Charles Brunet and Jacques Dumas were in favor of founding a political party that would work towards pacifist goals. During the 1890s the APD became the dominant French peace association, replacing the Society for Arbitration.Starting in 1902 the French pacifist societies began to meet at a National Peace Congress, which often had several hundred attendees.However, they were unable to unify the pacifist forces apart from setting up a small Permanent Delegation of French Pacifist Societies in 1902, led by Charles Richet (1850–1935), with Lucien Le Foyer as Secretary-General.The 1902 Peace Conference was held in Monaco. The British Peace Society did not send representatives, since they considered the location ""one of the blackest and most deadly moral plague spots in the whole world."" The feminist writer and teacher Jeanne Mélin was influenced by the socialist and pacifist Jean Jaurès.From 1900 to 1914 Mélin fought for a moderate pacifism based on arbitration of disputes as a member of the ADP.Mélin, who also belonged to the Societé d'education pacifique, led the APD in the Auvergne.The association published the journal La Paix par le droit (Peace through Law) for over fifty years, disseminating intellectual and pacifist analysis of the international situation.There were 8,000 subscribers to La Paix par le droit in 1914, on the eve of World War I (1914–18). The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace provided support to the APD as well as to the Comité de conciliation internationale.In 1911 Théodore Ruyssen, president of the APD, issued a report that concluded that, ""Any lasting solution to the problem of disarmament must be subordinated to achieving durable security through the construction of a juridical international system capable of pushing aside or resolving disputes between nations."" The report formed the basis for discussion by a national congress of French peace organizations that met on 5 June 1911 to consider what conditions were needed for international disarmament. On 28 July 1914 Austria declared war on Serbia, the opening move in the war.The APD sent urgent telegrams to the European chancelleries reminding them that under the Hague Conventions they had agreed to use arbibration before going to war, and put up posters throughout Paris calling for peaceful solutions to the issues.During World War I the association avoided defeatism, and took a position of ""patriotic pacifism."" Despite this, the journal was often subject to censorship.In June 1915 the APD published a ""minimum program"" for building an international order after the war. It called for self-determination, the completion of the juridical project undertaken at the Hague peace conferences, and the constitution of a ""society of peaceful nations committed to compulsory arbitration. Interwar period. After World War I the APD was unable to forgive the Germans and Austrians, whom they felt bore full responsibility for the war and had used brutal methods of waging war.The German pacifist Dr. Alfred Hermann Fried wrote in 1920 that he regretted that the victory of democracy had not resulted in a democratic peace, and that the Treaty of Versailles was radically anti-pacifist. Two months later Jules L. Puech, editor of the APD journal, wrote that he could not suddenly come to love the people whom he had been fighting.Théodore Ruyssen expressed similar views in 1922. By the early 1920s the association led the French pacifist movement, which remained highly fragmented. There were 5,000 subscribers to La Paix par le droit in 1920, rising to 8000 in 1924, then declining to 5,300 by 1935.In the 1920s the APD launched a second journal, Les Peuples unis (The United Peoples), aimed at a more popular readership. Every year the APD published a booklet titled Jeunesse et la paix du monde (Youth and World Peace) that was distributed worldwide. 108,000 copies of French version of the booklet were printed in 1933, and almost 250,000 copies in Dutch, Polish, English, Welsh, Esperanto, Chinese and Malay. Members of the association spread the message through public lectures and organized pacifist summer schools. At the 23rd International Peace Conference in Berlin in 1924 a growing divergence was evident between the moderate and intransigent camps of pacifists. The APD wanted to work towards a system of international law through which peace could be ""organized"", and felt that abstract and inflexible ideological statements damaged the cause.In 1925 the APD debated the question of conscientious objection, which it rejected in a heated debate as an unacceptable individual approach based on faith. This issue was a divisive topic throughout the 1920s. The APD did not think the problem of peace could be solved through a purely individual point of view, but did call for immediate definition of the status of conscientious objectors. During the 1930s the APD saw Adolf Hitler seize power, the 1932-33 World Disarmament Conference end in failure, France standing aside as Italy invaded Ethiopia and a resurgent Germany reoccupying the Rhineland. All these events showed that the legal edifice to preserve peace had failed.The APD during this period wanted to avoid interference in domestic politics or the affairs of other countries. It favored sanctions against Italy, but was against involvement in the Spanish Civil War for fear that it would escalate into an international conflict. The Communist-dominated World Committee Against War and Fascism was formed by the leaders of the Congress of Amsterdam in 1932 and the Congress of the Salle Pleyel in 1933.The APD would not cooperate with this ""radical"" organization or with the International League of Peace Fighters (Ligue internationale des combattants de la paix).In 1934, with the weakness of the League of Nations becoming clear, the APD rejected the idea of merging with other members of the French Federation for the League of Nations. It maintained its central position between the left-wing ""peace at any price"" school and the right-wing school that felt the League of Nations was the final goal of pacifism.In 1938, despite the growing tensions that would lead to World War II (1939–1945), the APD remained convinced of its ideals and optimistic about a more peaceful future. The APD disappeared in 1948."
